# Resource Management

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Resource Management

## General Principles of Resource Management

- **Definition**: Resource management covers all aspects of the planning, acquisition, deployment, and control of the resources required to deliver a project, programme, or portfolio.

- **Resources**: These include people, machinery, materials, technology, property, and anything else required to deliver the work. Resources may be obtained internally from the host organisation or procured from external sources (suppliers).

### The Goals of Resource Management

- The primary goals of this function are to:
    
    1. Determine the best way to **resource** the work (the resourcing strategy).
    
    2. **Acquire and mobilise** the necessary resources.
    
    3. **Control** resources throughout the life cycle.
    
    4. **Demobilise** resources at the end of the life cycle.
    
    5. Finalise all **contractual arrangements**.

### The Three Main Components of Resource Management

1. **Procurement**:
    
    - This is primarily concerned with identifying and selecting **external suppliers**.
    
    - Many of the principles (e.g., clear specification of requirements) can also be applied to securing internal suppliers.
    
    - The degree of formality required will depend on the complexity of the supply chain and the associated risk.

2. **Contract Management**:
    
    - This deals with the continuing relationship between the management team and its suppliers.
    
    - This relationship may be governed by a formal legal **contract**, an internal **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**, or simpler documented agreements for supply.

3. **Mobilisation**:
    
    - This is about getting the **right resources in the right place at the right time**.
    
    - It also covers the reverse exercise of **demobilisation** when the resources are no longer required.

## The Resource Management Procedure

1. **Plan**:
    - A **resource management plan** is created. This initially defines how resources should be procured, mobilised, and controlled according to organisational policies (e.g., policies for tendering, contracting, and matrix management).

2. **Initiate**:
    - The resources and infrastructure needed to perform the resource management function itself are mobilised.

3. **Identify and Specify Resources**:
    - This step involves an assessment of what resources are needed to complete the scope of work.

4. **Procure Resources**:
    - This step can be a significant project in itself and must consider factors such as:
        
        - The decision to **make or buy**.
        
        - The use of a single integrated supplier vs. multiple specialist suppliers.
        
        - Formal supplier selection processes (e.g., tendering).
        
        - The desired supplier relationships (e.g., partnership vs. transactional).
        
        - The conditions and forms of contract or agreement.
        
        - Payment methods and internal cross-charging mechanisms.

5. **Mobilise Resources**:
    - The management infrastructure is set up and the acquired resources are put in place.

6. **Control Resources**:
    - Once in place, resources need to be controlled. This involves activities such as monitoring progress, rescheduling work, reviewing contracts or SLAs, responding to resource issues, introducing new resources, and closing contracts for completed work.

7. **Demobilise Resources**:
    - At the end of the work, the resource infrastructure is dismantled. This includes the disposal of capital assets, the formal closure of all contracts, and the redeployment of internal staff.

### Acquiring Internal vs. External Resources

- **External Resources**: Normally acquired through a formal procurement procedure that involves tendering and results in a legal contract. For complex or innovative requirements, the P3 manager may enter into a dialogue with potential suppliers to help develop the solution, but clear rules on confidentiality and fairness must be maintained.

- **Internal Resources**: May be governed by formal SLAs or simple Terms of Reference.

> [!CAUTION]  
> All too often, arrangements for the provision of internal resources are informal and undocumented. This can lead to the P3 manager having no real control over whether the right resources are available at the right time. Even small projects benefit from some form of documented agreement between the management team and the departments providing the resources.

## Resource Management in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Projects

- Some projects will be completely internal, drawing purely on the resources of the host organisation. In this situation, the project manager will need good **negotiation and influencing skills** to compete for limited internal resources. The **project sponsor** has an important role to play in ensuring the host organisation commits to providing these resources.

- Larger, more complex projects will utilise a mixture of internal and external resources. The project manager may need support from specialists who have expertise in supplier selection and contract negotiations.

### Programmes

- The different elements of a programme will have varying resource needs. For example, the projects may make greater use of external resources, while the change management and benefits realisation work is primarily done by internal resources.

- The programme manager must define how the responsibility for managing resources will be shared between the project and programme levels in a **programme-level resource management plan**.

- The approach should provide co-ordination while delegating sufficient authority to individual projects. The programme manager will need to consider factors such as:
    
    - Elements of the management infrastructure that can be shared between projects.
    
    - Opportunities for **pan-programme procurement** (e.g., negotiating a bulk deal with a major supplier for all projects).
    
    - Structuring tranches to make resource usage more efficient across the programme.

> [IMPORTANT]  
> Projects and programmes are sometimes initiated without the resource implications being fully understood. All aspects of resource management, particularly the impact on business-as-usual, need to be thoroughly investigated during the definition process.

### Portfolios

- The infrastructure of a portfolio is usually permanent, but the resource demands will vary according to the number of concurrent projects and programmes.

- The portfolio management team must constantly **balance the commitment** to new and existing projects and programmes with the **capacity of the host organisation** to provide the necessary resources.

- This is a key part of the portfolio management process, where the team must prioritise the allocation of limited resources to the initiatives that provide the most strategic value.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the three main components of resource management?
    - **A:** Procurement, Contract Management, and Mobilisation.

- **Q:** What is the key difference between mobilisation and demobilisation?
    - **A:** **Mobilisation** is about getting the right resources in the right place at the right time. **Demobilisation** is the reverse exercise of dismantling the infrastructure and redeploying resources when they are no longer required.

- **Q:** What is the major risk of using informal, undocumented agreements for internal resources?
    - **A:** The P3 manager has no real control over whether the right resources will be available at the right time, as departmental priorities can change.

- **Q:** What is "pan-programme procurement"?
    - **A:** The practice of co-ordinating procurement across multiple projects within a programme to gain advantages such as bulk discounts or better contract terms.

- **Q:** What is the key resource management task of a portfolio management team?
    - **A:** To constantly balance the resource demands of the component projects and programmes with the capacity of the host organisation to provide those resources, and to prioritise allocation accordingly.
