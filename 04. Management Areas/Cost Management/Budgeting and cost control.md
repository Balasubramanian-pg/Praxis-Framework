# Comprehensive Study Notes: Budgeting and Cost Control

## General Principles of Budgeting and Cost Control

- **Definition**: Budgeting and cost control includes the detailed estimation of costs, the setting of agreed budgets, and the control of actual costs against that budget throughout the life cycle.

### The Goals of Budgeting and Cost Control

- The primary goals of this function are to:
    
    1. Determine the **income and expenditure profiles** for the work.
    
    2. Develop formal **budgets** and align them with the available funding.
    
    3. Implement systems to manage and control income and expenditure.

## The Budgeting and Cost Control Procedure

1. **Plan**:
    - This initial step results in a **finance management plan**, which defines how costs will be estimated, budgeted, and controlled.

2. **Initiate**:
    - The resources and systems needed to perform the financial management function are mobilised.

3. **Estimate Cost**:
    - Initial cost estimates are based on comparative or parametric techniques. These are refined as a more detailed understanding of the scope, schedule, and resources is developed.

4. **Develop Budget**:
    - The refined cost estimates are used to create the formal budget.

5. **Secure Funds**:
    - This step ensures that the approved budget is backed by secured funding. It should be closely aligned with the "administer funding" step of the funding procedure.

6. **Control Cost**:
    - As the work gets underway, this step involves tracking actual costs against the budget and taking corrective action as needed.

## The Components of a P3 Budget

- A budget is the baseline against which actual expenditure and the predicted final cost of the work are reported.

### 1. The Base Cost Estimate

- This is the cost of the work according to the schedule. It is typically made up of costs associated with resources, accommodation, consumables, expenses, and capital items.

- These base costs have two pairs of possible attributes:
    
    - **Direct vs. Indirect**: Direct costs are directly attributable to the P3 work. Indirect costs are overheads shared with other parts of the host organisation.
    
    - **Fixed vs. Variable**: Fixed costs remain the same regardless of how the work proceeds (e.g., capital purchase). Variable costs fluctuate with the amount of work done (e.g., salaries, fees).

- If the financial systems allow, costs can be broken down into a **Cost Breakdown Structure (CBS)**, which can be aligned with the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Organisational Breakdown Structure (OBS).

### 2. Contingency Reserve

- The risk management function will identify the potential cost of dealing with **known risks**. This amount is allocated to a contingency budget or reserve.

### 3. Management Reserve

- Even the best risk management cannot foresee all possible causes of additional cost. A further level of reserve, known as the **management reserve**, is held by the **sponsor** to cover these **unforeseen circumstances**.

- Highly innovative and uncertain work will require a larger management reserve than routine work.

> [IMPORTANT]  
> The three major components of a P3 budget are, therefore: the base cost estimate, the contingency reserve, and the management reserve.

## The Cost Control Process

### Cash Flow and Funding

- Once the budget is approved, the cumulative expenditure is often shown as an **S-curve**.

- This profile allows a **cash flow forecast** to be developed, which is then used to agree on the schedule for the drawdown of funds.

### Tracking Costs

- As work proceeds, three types of costs must be tracked:
    
    1. **Committed Costs**: Confirmed orders for future goods or services.
    
    2. **Accruals**: Work that has been completed for which payment will be due.
    
    3. **Actual Costs**: Money that has already been paid out.

- The **Forecast Cost** (or Estimate at Completion) is the sum of commitments, accruals, actual expenditure, plus the estimated cost to complete the remaining work.

### Tolerances and Escalation

- The profile of actual expenditure will inevitably be different from the planned expenditure.

- The P3 manager is typically responsible for managing the base costs within pre-agreed thresholds known as **tolerances**.

- If expenditure is predicted to exceed these tolerances, the manager must **escalate this issue** to the sponsor.

- Dealing with increased costs may involve drawing funds from the contingency or management reserves, reducing the scope of the work, or securing additional funds.

### Sunk Costs

- Periodically, the business case must be formally reviewed to ensure the work is still viable.

- In the latter stages of the work, this review must consider **sunk costs**. These are actual and committed expenditures that cannot be recovered.

- Completing an overspent project may still be considered worthwhile if the remaining cost to complete the work is less than the eventual value that will be realised.

## Application in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Scale and Complexity

- While the principles of P3 accounting are common regardless of scale, the volume and diversity of transactions change dramatically with complexity.

- A spreadsheet may be adequate for a small project, but an international portfolio will need to handle multiple currencies and provide different financial reports for many different stakeholders.

### Sophisticated Techniques

- As work becomes more complex, more sophisticated cost control techniques can be justified.

- **Earned Value Management (EVM)** is a powerful technique that combines the tracking of costs with the tracking of progress.
    
    - EVM takes the budget and uses it to represent the "value" of the work.
    
    - The "earned value" of work performed can then be compared to the actual cost of performing it and the planned value.
    
    - This enables much more accurate predictions of future cost and schedule performance based on actual performance to date.
    
    - The overheads of implementing EVM can be significant, so it is unlikely to be effective on smaller projects unless mandated by a parent programme or portfolio.

### Programmes and Portfolios

- Programme and portfolio management teams must balance the need for **consistency** of budgeting and cost control across all components with the need to apply techniques that are **appropriate** to the context of each component.

- The finance management plan at the programme or portfolio level should provide advice on estimating and cost control techniques while ensuring that costs reported by components can be meaningfully **aggregated** to provide comprehensive financial reporting.

- This aggregated cost information is essential for the **prioritisation and balancing** activities in the portfolio management process.

- Strategic portfolios are often aligned with corporate financial cycles. Their budgets are less concerned with the cost of delivering a specific result and more to do with **what can be delivered within a defined budget**.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the three major components of a P3 budget?
    - **A:** The base cost estimate, the contingency reserve, and the management reserve.

- **Q:** What is the difference between the contingency reserve and the management reserve?
    - **A:** The **contingency reserve** is for dealing with known, identified risks. The **management reserve**, held by the sponsor, is for dealing with unforeseen circumstances (unknown risks).

- **Q:** What are the three types of costs that must be tracked during the control process?
    - **A:** Committed costs, accruals, and actual costs.

- **Q:** What are "sunk costs"?
    - **A:** Actual and committed expenditure that cannot be recovered, even if the project is cancelled.

- **Q:** What is Earned Value Management (EVM)?
    - **A:** A sophisticated control technique that integrates the tracking of cost, schedule, and scope to provide more accurate predictions of future performance.
