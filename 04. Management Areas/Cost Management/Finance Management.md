# Comprehensive Study Notes: Financial Management Capability Maturity

## Overall Goal of Financial Management

- The function of Financial Management should:
    
    - Estimate the cost of achieving the objectives.
    
    - Assess the viability of achieving the objectives.
    
    - Secure funds and manage their release throughout the life cycle.
    
    - Set up and run appropriate financial systems.
    
    - Monitor and control expenditure.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a summary-level capability that combines the individual capabilities for the functions that make up financial management (Estimating, Investment Appraisal, Funding, Budgeting, and Cost Control).  
> <br><br>  
> This summary is most relevant for projects that are entirely funded from a single source and use existing corporate financial control systems.  
> <br><br>  
> The more detailed, subsidiary capability models for each function should be used in more complex situations, such as where:
> 
> - Funding is external or comes from multiple sources.
> 
> - The business case requires more sophisticated investment appraisal.
> 
> - The scale of the work requires its own dedicated financial control systems.

## Level 2 Capability Attributes

- At this level, financial management is **performed and managed**. The goals are generally achieved, but the processes may be basic and rely heavily on existing corporate systems that may not be ideal for project accounting.

- **Estimate Costs**
    
    - Top-down estimates are performed early in the life cycle (e.g., using analogy or expert judgement).
    
    - These are refined with bottom-up estimates as detailed specifications become available.

- **Investment Appraisal**
    - Simple appraisal techniques (e.g., basic payback period) are used and documented in the business case.

- **Secure Funding**
    - Routine, standard sources of internal funding are identified and confirmed.

- **Develop Budget**
    
    - An overall budget for the work is documented.
    
    - Progress reports track actual expenditure against this single, high-level budget.

- **Financial Control**
    - Actual costs are captured accurately and are used to track performance against the budget.

## Level 3 Capability Attributes

- At this level, financial management is performed according to a **defined, standard process** that is tailored to the context of the work. The techniques used are more sophisticated and consistent across the organisation.

- **Estimate Costs**
    - Cost estimates are not a one-off activity; they are actively **reviewed throughout the life cycle**, and plans are updated accordingly to reflect new information.

- **Investment Appraisal**
    - Detailed **quantitative techniques** (e.g., Net Present Value - NPV, Internal Rate of Return - IRR) are used to assess the viability of the work, providing a more robust justification.

- **Secure Funding**
    - A **variety of funding mechanisms** (e.g., internal, external, joint funding) is considered, and the optimum approach is consciously chosen based on an analysis of the options.

- **Develop Budget**
    
    - The budget is more sophisticated. **Separate budgets** are identified for different aspects of the work (e.g., by work package or by cost type).
    
    - Formal budgets for **contingency** (for known risks) and **management reserves** (for unknown risks) are used.

- **Financial Control**
    - Financial systems are able to track actual costs against specific **categories of cost**, as defined in a formal **Cost Breakdown Structure (CBS)**, allowing for much more detailed analysis and control.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** How does cost estimating differ between Level 2 and Level 3?
    - **A:** At Level 2, estimates are created and refined once. At Level 3, cost estimates are actively **reviewed throughout the life cycle**, and plans are updated.

- **Q:** What is the key difference in the investment appraisal techniques used at Level 2 versus Level 3?
    - **A:** Level 2 uses **simple** appraisal techniques (like payback). Level 3 uses detailed **quantitative** techniques (like NPV and IRR).

- **Q:** How does the structure of the budget change from Level 2 to Level 3?
    - **A:** At Level 2, there is a single overall budget. At Level 3, there are **separate budgets** for different aspects of the work, and formal budgets for **contingency and management reserves** are used.

- **Q:** What level of detail does financial control at Level 3 provide that Level 2 does not?
    - **A:** Level 3 financial systems can track costs against specific categories as defined in a **Cost Breakdown Structure (CBS)**, whereas Level 2 tracks against a single overall budget.
