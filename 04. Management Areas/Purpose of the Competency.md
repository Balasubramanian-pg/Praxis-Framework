# Comprehensive Study Notes: Manage Change Competency

## Purpose of the Competency

- The purpose of this competency is to demonstrate the ability to achieve the goals of **change management**. These goals are to:
    
    1. Define the **organisational change** required to convert project outputs into business benefits.
    
    2. Ensure the organisation is **prepared** to implement the change.
    
    3. **Implement** the change and **embed** it into normal organisational practice.

> [NOTE]  
> This competency is about managing the people and process side of change within the business, not the technical change to the project's scope (which is handled by change control).

## Performance Criteria

- An individual must be able to demonstrate the ability to perform the following actions:

- **Plan and initiate change**
    
    - This involves defining the overall approach, principles, roles, and responsibilities for managing the organisational change.
    
    - The output is typically a **change management plan**.

- **Identify the change required to existing practices**
    
    - This involves a detailed analysis of the current state ("as-is") and the desired future state ("to-be").
    
    - The output is a clear definition of the required changes to business processes, systems, organisational structures, and job roles. This is often documented in a **blueprint** at the programme level.

- **Assess the organisation’s readiness to change**
    
    - This involves analysing the organisation's culture, the level of dissatisfaction with the current situation, and the likely sources and strength of resistance to the proposed change.
    
    - It includes assessing the capacity of the affected business units to absorb the change.

- **Communicate and implement change**
    
    - This is the core execution step. It involves communicating a compelling vision for the change, engaging with stakeholders to build support, and implementing the practical steps needed to transition from the old way of working to the new.
    
    - It includes managing resistance and removing obstacles to the change.

- **Ensure that new practices are embedded in business-as-usual**
    
    - This is the "sustain" phase. Change is not complete until the new ways of working have become the normal, everyday practice.
    
    - This involves monitoring the adoption of the new practices, providing ongoing support and training, and reinforcing the new behaviours until they are fully embedded.

- **Maintain change management documentation**
    - This involves creating and maintaining the key change management documents, such as the change management plan, stakeholder engagement plans, and communications related to the change.

- **Assure the quality of change management**
    - This involves ensuring that the agreed-upon procedures for managing change are being followed correctly and that the change management activities are having the desired effect.

> [IMPORTANT]  
> The amount of organisational change required can vary considerably, as can the consequences of managing it badly. This competency is relevant to several roles (e.g., Programme Manager, Business Change Manager) that have different perspectives on change. The application of the competency must be matched to the importance of change management in the context of the work and the specific role.

## Knowledge and Understanding

- An individual needs to know and understand the following principles and concepts:

- **The principles and goals of change management**
    - Understanding that the purpose of change management is to manage the people side of change to successfully transition from a current state to a desired future state to achieve benefits.

- **Responsibilities for change management**
    - Knowing who is responsible for what, particularly the distinct roles of the Programme Manager (delivers the capability for change) and the **Business Change Manager (BCM)** (implements the change within the business and realises the benefits).

- **The context of the work and its impact on change management**
    - Understanding how the nature of the organisation (its culture, structure, history with change) will impact the change management approach.

- **A procedure for change management**
    - Understanding a typical change management procedure: Plan, Assess Readiness, Prepare, Implement, and Sustain.

- **The purpose and content of change management documentation**
    - Knowing the purpose of key documents like the change management plan and the blueprint.

- **How to specify change**
    - Understanding how to define the future state of the organisation in terms of its processes, people, systems, and structures.

- **Models that describe the nature of organisational change**
    - Being familiar with different models that explain how organisations and individuals react to change, such as:
        
        - **Lewin's** "Unfreeze-Change-Refreeze" model.
        
        - **Kotter's** 8-Step Change Model.
        
        - The **Change Curve** (based on the Kübler-Ross grief cycle).
        
        - The "Formula for Change": C = (A x B x D) > X.

- **How to communicate change**
    - Understanding the principles of creating and communicating a compelling vision for change to gain buy-in and support.

- **Techniques for assessing readiness to change**
    - Knowing how to use tools and techniques (e.g., surveys, workshops, stakeholder analysis) to gauge an organisation's willingness and ability to adopt a proposed change.

- **Methods for overcoming resistance to change**
    - Understanding the common sources of resistance and knowing a range of strategies to manage it, such as communication, participation, negotiation, and support.

- **How to ensure changes are embedded in business-as-usual**
    - Understanding the techniques for reinforcing new behaviours and processes until they become the "new normal," such as performance measurement, rewards, and ongoing coaching.

- **How assurance applies to change management**
    - Understanding how to review the change management function to ensure its activities are being performed effectively and are leading to the successful adoption of the change.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the three primary goals of change management?
    - **A:** 1. Define the required organisational change, 2. Ensure the organisation is prepared for the change, and 3. Implement and embed the change into practice.

- **Q:** What is the key difference between the roles of a Programme Manager and a Business Change Manager (BCM)?
    - **A:** The **Programme Manager** is typically responsible for delivering the project outputs (the _capability_ for change). The **BCM** is responsible for implementing that capability within the business to change working practices and _realise the benefits_.

- **Q:** What does the "A" in the formula for change, C = (A x B x D) > X, represent?
    - **A:** The level of **dissatisfaction** with the current situation.

- **Q:** Why is the "Sustain" step of the change management procedure so important?
    - **A:** Because for changes to deliver their full, long-term benefits, they must be embedded and become the normal way of working. Without this step, people may revert to the old ways of working over time.

- **Q:** Name two models that can be used to understand the nature of organisational change.
    - **A:** Any two from: Lewin's model (Unfreeze-Change-Refreeze), Kotter's 8-Step Model, or the Change Curve.
