# Comprehensive Study Notes: Information Management

## General Principles of Information Management

- **Definition**: Information management is the collection, storage, dissemination, archiving, and eventual destruction of project, programme, and portfolio information.

### The Goals of Information Management

- The primary goals of this function are to:
    
    1. Capture data **accurately and consistently**.
    
    2. Develop usable **information** from raw data.
    
    3. Maintain information **securely and accessibly** during its useful life.
    
    4. Support effective **decision-making and communication**.

> [NOTE]  
> It is important to distinguish between data and information. Data is the raw facts and figures collected during the work. Information is the output of analysing and interpreting that data to make it meaningful and useful for decision-making.

## The Information Management Procedure

- The creation of data starts as soon as the initial mandate is issued. Therefore, information management procedures and responsibilities need to be defined early in the life cycle.

1. **Plan**:
    
    - This step defines the standards for information management, often conforming to wider organisational standards.
    
    - Any necessary adaptations for particular contexts (e.g., regulatory or high-security requirements) are specified.
    
    - The standards are set out in the **information management plan**.

2. **Initiate**:
    - This step ensures the necessary resources are mobilised and the required IT infrastructure (e.g., document repositories, reporting tools) is in place.

3. **Collect Data**:
    
    - In the early life cycle phases, data collection focuses on requirements and solution development.
    
    - It then moves on to the creation of management and delivery plans.
    
    - As the work progresses into delivery, performance data is collected to support the control function.

4. **Process Information**:
    
    - Data must be collected consistently and accurately so that it can be transformed into usable information for the management team and stakeholders.
    
    - This is made much easier if standard techniques are adopted to capture and analyse the data, and standard documents are used to present the resulting information.

5. **Distribute Information**:
    
    - The expected distribution of documents will be set out in many relevant management plans, with the **stakeholder management plan** being particularly significant.
    
    - The timing of the distribution may be set out in a **communications plan**.

6. **Archive Information**:
    
    - Most information on a project is transient, meaning it is superseded over time by newer versions.
    
    - This does not mean it should be destroyed. Superseded information should be archived in case it is needed in the future, particularly in the case of contractual documentation that may be needed in the event of a dispute.
    
    - Organisational policies, often reflecting statutory obligations (e.g., for financial accounting), will dictate how long archives must be maintained.

> [IMPORTANT]  
> A key part of information management is configuration management, which controls the versions of key documents to ensure that everyone is working from the correct and most up-to-date information. The information management plan will define how information is classified, stored, and controlled.

## Key Concepts in Information Management

### Tailoring and Maturity

- It is important not to see standard document definitions as being rigidly fixed.

- One of the generic attributes of **level 3 capability maturity** is that all documentation is based on organisational standards but has been **tailored** to suit the context in which it is being used.

### Security and Accessibility

- Information storage must be designed with three key factors in mind:
    
    1. **Accessibility**: Information must be easily available to those who are authorised to see it.
    
    2. **Security**: Information must be protected from unauthorised access or alteration.
    
    3. **Confidentiality**: Sensitive information must be protected from being disclosed to unauthorised individuals.

### The Link to Knowledge Management

- Some information has a different intrinsic value, characterised by the "lessons learned."

- Some material from the information management system will become part of a **knowledge management system**.

- This enables individual managers to learn from the experiences of others and helps the organisation to develop its overall capability maturity.

- It makes sense for the information management system and the knowledge management system to work in a similar and compatible way.

## Information Management in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Small Projects

- On small projects, information management is often part of the project manager’s role. It can be seen as an administrative burden that takes time away from the "important" job of managing the project.

- Documentation is like insurance: until it’s needed to solve a problem, it isn’t missed if it isn’t there.

- How an organisation supports its managers in this area is a key indicator of its **capability maturity**. A mature organisation will have standards and resources (e.g., from a support office) in place to lighten the administrative burden, particularly on the managers of small projects.

### Programmes, Portfolios, and Larger Projects

- These larger initiatives will be able to justify dedicated staff to help with information management, often as part of a **support office**.

- Programmes and portfolios need to address three particular factors regarding information management:
    
    1. **Consistency**: Ensuring consistency of information management across all component projects, programmes, and business-as-usual areas. For example, ensuring all projects in a multinational programme report costs in the same currency and using the same exchange rate mechanisms. Without consistency, it is impossible to aggregate information automatically to create an overall picture.
    
    2. **Co-ordination**: Actively co-ordinating the flow of information across the programme or portfolio.
    
    3. **Distinguishing Levels**: Clearly distinguishing between information that is relevant at the portfolio, programme, and project levels.

> [NOTE]  
> The portfolio management team is likely to have responsibility for both knowledge management and the development of capability maturity. Since information management is closely linked to both of these areas, the portfolio management team must take a long-term, strategic view to ensure that good practice is embedded in the organisation.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is the difference between data and information?
    - **A:** **Data** is the raw, unanalysed facts and figures. **Information** is the output of analysing and interpreting that data to make it meaningful for decision-making.

- **Q:** What is the primary purpose of an information management plan?
    - **A:** To set out the standards, procedures, and responsibilities for how information will be collected, stored, distributed, and archived for a project, programme, or portfolio.

- **Q:** What is a key attribute of a level 3 mature organisation regarding documentation?
    - **A:** That all documentation is based on organisational standards but has been **tailored** to suit the context in which it is being used.

- **Q:** Why is consistency of information management so important in a programme or portfolio?
    - **A:** Without consistency in how data is recorded (e.g., using the same currency for costs), it is impossible to aggregate information automatically to create a valid overall picture of performance.

- **Q:** What is configuration management?
    - **A:** The process of controlling the versions of key documents to ensure that everyone is working from the correct and most up-to-date information.
