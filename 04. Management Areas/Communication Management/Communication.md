# Comprehensive Study Notes: Communication

## General Principles of Communication

- **Definition**: Communication is the means by which information is exchanged and a common understanding is achieved between individuals or groups.

- **The Goals of Communication**:
    - At its most basic level, the goals are to:
        
        1. Impart relevant information.
        
        2. Ensure that the information is correctly understood.

- **Application in the P3 Environment**: In project, programme, and portfolio management, these basic goals are a means to achieving more significant objectives:
    
    - Ensuring that members of the management team understand the objectives and their specific role in achieving them.
    
    - Building and maintaining strong, positive relationships with stakeholders.
    
    - Minimising conflict by avoiding misunderstandings and misinterpretations.
    
    - Developing confidence and trust between all parties.
    
    - Maintaining the long-term commitment of stakeholders and team members.
    
    - Enabling the effective control of the work throughout its entire life cycle.

- **Forms of Communication**:
    
    - Communication comes in many forms. The primary forms are **written**, **verbal**, and **body language**.
    
    - These are modified by many other factors, such as whether they are **formal** or **informal**; **active** or **passive**; **conscious** or **unconscious**.

## The Communication Process and its Components

- Simple models, such as Berlo’s SMCR (Source, Message, Channel, Receiver) model, provide a useful structure for understanding the complex aspects of communication.

- **The Basic Model**: In its simplest form, communication involves:
    
    1. The **Source** (the person who originates a message).
    
    2. The **Channel** (the medium for communicating that message).
    
    3. The **Receiver** (the person who receives the message).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The first critical step for a P3 manager or sponsor (the source) is to decide what needs to be communicated, to whom, and when. This principle is formally embodied in the stakeholder management function and the resulting communication plan.

- **Factors Influencing Messages**: The way a source creates a message and the way a receiver interprets that same message will depend on numerous personal and contextual factors, such as:
    
    - Their personal values and cultural background.
    
    - Their vested interests in the work.
    
    - Their current frame of mind.
    
    - Their personal ‘learning style’ (e.g., whether they respond better to auditory, visual, or kinaesthetic channels of communication).

> [!NOTE]  
> An effective P3 manager and sponsor must take all these factors into account when deciding on the content, structure, and channel for their communications to ensure the message is received as intended.

## Channels and Barriers of Communication

- **Channels of Communication**:
    
    - The range of available communication channels is constantly increasing.
    
    - Traditional channels such as paper documents, telephone calls, and face-to-face meetings are being supplemented and often replaced by email, social media, and web/tele-conferencing.
    
    - Every new channel brings its own unique opportunities and challenges for effective communication.

- **Barriers to Communication**:
    - All communication will encounter barriers that can distort or block the message. These can include:
        
        - **Obvious Barriers**: Different languages in international teams or trying to be heard in a noisy physical environment.
        
        - **Jargon**: Habitual use of acronyms and technical jargon can make communication more efficient for insiders but can alienate and confuse those who are not familiar with it.
        
        - **Hidden Barriers**: These can be more difficult to identify and overcome, and include a history of conflict between parties or a general lack of trust.

## Communication, Documentation, and Maturity

- Frameworks like Praxis contain many document definitions and associated templates. These are primary vehicles for formal, written communication.

> [!CAUTION]  
> Standard documents and templates are vehicles for communication, not a replacement for it. While consistency is useful, it must not become the primary objective. If a particular message needs to be structured and presented in a different way to be effective, the standard document must be tailored or even disregarded in favour of a more effective approach.

- This principle of tailoring is a key indicator of organisational capability maturity:
    
    - **Level 2 Maturity**: A common characteristic is that "standard reports are distributed at regular intervals."
    
    - **Level 3 Maturity**: A common characteristic is that "standard documentation is **adapted to suit the context**."

- Since communication is the primary means by which tacit knowledge (experience) is converted into explicit knowledge (documented information), it is a vital part of the broader **knowledge management** function.

## Communication in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

- The basic principles of communication are exactly the same regardless of the complexity of the work. However, the way those principles are **applied** will be greatly affected by the context.

- **Small, Non-Complex Projects**:
    
    - It is common for most communication to be verbal and informal.
    
    - This is acceptable as long as key decisions are properly documented and communicated in a form that relies less on memory and interpretation.

- **Bigger, More Complex Projects**:
    
    - The use of standard documentation becomes more important to ensure consistency of information.
    
    - This makes it easier for a larger number of people to be involved in both preparing and receiving information, subject to appropriate tailoring.

- **Programmes and Large Complex Projects**:
    
    - The audiences for communication become large and diverse.
    
    - Careful and detailed **planning of communication** becomes ever more important.
    
    - The **co-ordination** of different messages to ensure consistency is a critical task.
    
    - At this scale, the P3 manager may have to supervise others (perhaps a dedicated support team) who are doing the bulk of the communication activities.

- **Portfolio Level**:
    
    - The management of formal information can be handled through formal information management procedures.
    
    - However, the effectiveness of the vast amount of informal communication depends on the competency of individuals, the leadership of the P3 managers, and the maturity of the organisation.
    
    - At the portfolio level, the management team needs to focus on:
        
        1. The **co-ordination** of communication across all components.
        
        2. Perhaps more importantly, on creating a **culture of effective communication** within a strong ethical framework.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the two basic goals of communication?
    - **A:** 1. To impart relevant information, and 2. To ensure the information is understood.

- **Q:** What is the first critical step a P3 manager must take before communicating?
    - **A:** Decide what needs to be communicated, to whom, and when, which is formalized in the communication plan.

- **Q:** What is the biggest mistake to avoid when using standard document templates?
    - **A:** Treating the template as the primary objective instead of the message. Effective communication requires that templates are tailored or even disregarded if they are not the best way to convey the information.

- **Q:** How does communication typically differ between a small project and a large programme?
    - **A:** A small project relies more on informal, verbal communication. A large programme requires much more formal planning and co-ordination of communication to large, diverse audiences.

- **Q:** What is the primary focus of the portfolio management team regarding communication?
    - **A:** To co-ordinate communication across the entire portfolio and, more strategically, to create a culture of effective and ethical communication.
