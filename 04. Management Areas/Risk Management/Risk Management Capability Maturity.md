# Risk Management

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Risk Management Capability Maturity

## Overall Goal of Risk Management

- The function of Risk Management should:
    
    - Ensure that levels of overall risk are compatible with organisational objectives.
    
    - Ensure that individual risks and responses are identified.
    
    - Minimise the impact of threats to the objectives.
    
    - Optimise the realisation of opportunities within the scope of the work.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> A key difference between Level 2 and Level 3 capability in risk management is that at Level 3, techniques are appropriately applied.  
> <br><br>  
> It is not uncommon for risk management to be over-complicated in relation to the complexity of the work. For example, at Level 2, there may be an over-zealous identification of many minor risks, which can reduce the effectiveness of the function even though the basic goals are achieved. At Level 3, better weighting and analysis ensure that the effort and response planning are proportionate to the significance of the risks.

## Level 2 Capability Attributes

- At this level, risk management is **performed and managed**. The basic steps are followed, and the goals are generally achieved, but the application may be inconsistent or not fully optimised for the context.

- **Identify**
    - There is identification of both **threats and opportunities**.

- **Assess**
    - Risk events are assessed in terms of their basic properties: **probability, impact, and timing**.

- **Plan Responses**
    
    - Risk responses are planned for significant risks.
    
    - The activities required to implement these responses are adequately resourced.

- **Implement Responses**
    - The planned risk responses are implemented.

## Level 3 Capability Attributes

- At this level, risk management is performed according to a **defined, standard process** that is tailored to the context. The techniques are applied appropriately and consistently, and the process is integrated with the organisation's overall strategic approach to risk.

- **Identify**
    
    - A **range of techniques** (e.g., workshops, checklists, interviews) is used to identify appropriate threats and opportunities.
    
    - The identification process is not a one-off activity; risks are **continually reviewed** throughout the life cycle.

- **Assess**
    
    - Risk assessment is conducted from a **number of perspectives**, including strategic, operational, commercial, and internal to the initiative.
    
    - A range of **qualitative and quantitative techniques** (e.g., Probability-Impact Matrix, Monte Carlo analysis) is used _as appropriate_ for the nature of the risk and the complexity of the work.
    
    - The **overall risk** of the project or programme is assessed and matched to the organisation’s stated **risk appetite**.

- **Plan Responses**
    
    - Risk responses are planned according to **organisational policies** that have been adapted as necessary for the specific context of the work.
    
    - These response plans are reviewed throughout the life cycle.
    
    - **All appropriate response types** are utilised for both threats and opportunities.
    
    - Management team members with the **appropriate seniority** are assigned ownership of response activities.
    
    - The responses are developed in line with the organisation’s **risk attitude**.

- **Implement Responses**
    
    - Risk responses are implemented in accordance with the formal risk response plan.
    
    - The **effectiveness** of the implemented responses is actively **monitored**, and the results are fed back into revised plans and future risk assessments.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is a key difference between how risk management is applied at Level 2 versus Level 3?
    - **A:** At Level 2, techniques may be applied over-zealously, leading to inefficiency (e.g., tracking too many minor risks). At Level 3, techniques are applied **appropriately and proportionately** to the significance of the risks.

- **Q:** How does risk identification differ between Level 2 and Level 3?
    - **A:** At Level 2, threats and opportunities are identified. At Level 3, a **range of techniques** is used, and the process is **continually reviewed** throughout the life cycle, not just at the beginning.

- **Q:** What additional elements are considered during risk assessment at Level 3?
    - **A:** Risks are assessed from **multiple perspectives** (strategic, operational, etc.), a range of **qualitative and quantitative techniques** are used as appropriate, and the **overall risk** is matched to the organisation's **risk appetite**.

- **Q:** How does risk response planning at Level 3 demonstrate a more mature approach than at Level 2?
    - **A:** At Level 3, responses are planned according to **organisational policies**, take into account the organisation's **risk attitude**, and assign owners with the **appropriate seniority**.

- **Q:** What is the key activity in "Implement Responses" at Level 3 that is not explicitly stated for Level 2?
    - **A:** The **effectiveness** of the implemented responses is actively **monitored**, and the results are fed back into revised plans.
