# Comprehensive Study Notes: Control

## General Principles of Control

- **Definition**: Control is the management function that involves monitoring actual performance against approved baselines, updating delivery documents as necessary, and taking corrective action to manage deviations.

- Control is required throughout the entire life cycle, but this explanation is primarily aimed at controlling the **delivery process**.

### The Goals of Control

- The primary goals of the control function are to:
    
    1. Review performance against the established **baselines** (from the planning function).
    
    2. Evaluate the effect of actual performance to date on **future plans**.
    
    3. Take action as required to either achieve the original planning targets or agree on revised targets.

## The Three Categories of Control

- Control techniques fall into one of three broad categories: cybernetic, go/no-go, and post.

### 1. Cybernetic Control

- **Definition**: This is part of the day-to-day management of the work. The term ‘cybernetic’ is derived from the Greek for "helmsman," and a P3 manager uses cybernetic control to "steer" the project, programme, or portfolio on a continuous basis.

- **Key Element**: The key element of cybernetic control is the **feedback loop**.
    
    1. A system is monitored.
    
    2. Feedback on performance is provided.
    
    3. This feedback is compared to a norm (the baseline plan).
    
    4. Action is taken to align the system back to the norm.

- **Orders of Control**: The work of the P3 manager is, strictly speaking, **first-order** cybernetic control. The relationship between the P3 manager and their sponsor (who provides oversight and direction based on escalated issues) is **second-order** cybernetic control.

- **Tolerances**: These are the pre-agreed, acceptable deviations from the baselines. If performance is outside, or predicted to go outside, the agreed tolerances, this is classed as an **issue** that must be escalated to the sponsor for a decision on corrective action.

### 2. Go/No-Go Control

- **Definition**: This form of control is applied at the key decision points built into the life cycle, typically at the end of a phase, stage, or tranche.

- **Process**: It involves a major review of what has been delivered and the justification for continuing. The sponsor considers all available information and makes a formal decision on whether to **proceed** with the remaining work.

- **Outcome**: In extreme cases, a project, programme, or even a portfolio may be terminated at a go/no-go control point because it is no longer justifiable.

### 3. Post-Control

- **Definition**: This type of control is entirely retrospective.

- **Process**: It is concerned with **learning from experience** through formal reviews, such as post-project or post-programme reviews.

- **Linkage**: The outputs of post-control (lessons learned) are a key input to the "review previous lessons" activity in the identification process of future initiatives.

## Control Methods and Techniques

- Specific control methods are used according to the nature and complexity of what is being controlled. All six fundamental components of delivery (scope, schedule, cost, risk, change, resource) need to be controlled.

- **Schedule Performance**: A common method for illustrating schedule performance is the use of **RAG reports** (Red, Amber, Green).
    
    - **Green**: Performance is within tolerances and predicted to remain there.
    
    - **Amber**: Performance is currently within tolerances but is predicted to exceed them soon.
    
    - **Red**: Performance has already exceeded tolerances.

- **Scope Control (Quality Control)**:
    
    - In the context of creating outputs, control of scope is effectively the same as **quality control**.
    
    - It has the most diverse range of techniques, covering inspection, testing, and measurement to verify that deliverables conform to specification, are fit for purpose, and meet stakeholder expectations.
    
    - Example techniques include crushing concrete samples, reviewing user interfaces, x-raying welds, and following software test scripts.

- **Integrated Control**:
    - Some techniques bring together multiple elements. The most common is **Earned Value Management (EVM)**, which integrates scope, schedule, and cost performance to provide powerful predictive metrics.

### Time-Driven vs. Event-Driven Controls

- **Event-Driven Controls**: Go/no-go and post-control are event-driven. The events could be life cycle based (the end of a stage or tranche) or feedback-based (when tolerances are exceeded).

- **Time-Driven Controls**: These are more typical of cybernetic control and involve regular, periodic activities such as weekly or monthly reports, periodic reviews, or regular progress meetings.

> [!NOTE]  
> It is the P3 manager’s responsibility to collect progress data and prepare reports, highlighting areas that need attention. In some cases, this work will be done by a support function, freeing the manager to concentrate on decision-making and implementing corrective action.

## Control in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Projects

- The way progress data is collected and reported will depend on the planning techniques used.

- **Simple Projects**: If the schedule is a simple Gantt chart, progress may be shown as a **slip chart**.

- **Complex Projects**: As projects become more complex and schedules are based on network diagrams, more sophisticated control techniques like **Earned Value Management (EVM)** or **Critical Chain** can be used.
    - The more sophisticated the method, the more accurate the predictions. EVM is more predictive than simple critical path analysis because it assumes future performance will be in line with _historical_ performance, not the _original_ plan.

- **Agile Projects**:
    
    - While traditional projects tend to focus first on controlling time and cost, agile projects focus on controlling **scope**.
    
    - Control techniques like **Kanban** are used to control the flow of work within short, timeboxed sprints.
    
    - **Burn-down charts** are often a better way of illustrating progress over a number of sprints than Gantt charts.

### Programmes and Portfolios

- In programmes and portfolios, there will be multiple levels of cybernetic control. A project manager controls their project (level 1); the programme manager (acting as sponsor) provides oversight of the project (level 2); and if the programme is in a portfolio, the portfolio manager provides a third level of control.

- This does not mean multiple people are controlling the project day-to-day. Each level of control deals with a **different degree of detail** and has a different span of control.

- **Key System Requirements**: For this multi-level control system to work, it must explain for each level how:
    
    - Tolerances will be set.
    
    - Progress data will be gathered and reported.
    
    - Interdependencies between different plans will be monitored.
    
    - Progress information will be **consolidated upwards**.
    
    - Decisions will be **communicated downwards**.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> As work becomes more complex, it is vital to focus on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) rather than trying to monitor everything in great detail. The role of a support office (PSO/PMO) becomes indispensable as complexity increases, providing timely and accurate information to enable good decision-making.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the three main categories of control?
    - **A:** Cybernetic, Go/No-Go, and Post.

- **Q:** What is the key element of cybernetic control?
    - **A:** The feedback loop (monitor, provide feedback, compare to norm, take action).

- **Q:** What are "tolerances" in the context of control?
    - **A:** The pre-agreed, acceptable deviations from the baseline plans. Exceeding tolerances triggers an escalation to the sponsor.

- **Q:** In an agile project, what is the primary component of delivery that is being controlled?
    - **A:** Scope.

- **Q:** How does Earned Value Management (EVM) provide a more accurate forecast than simple critical path analysis?
    - **A:** Because EVM assumes future rates of progress will be in line with historical performance, whereas critical path analysis assumes future progress will be in line with the original plan.

- **Q:** In a multi-level programme or portfolio, what are two key requirements of the control system?
    - **A:** Any two from: explaining how tolerances are set, how data is reported, how interdependencies are monitored, how information is consolidated upwards, and how decisions are communicated downwards.
