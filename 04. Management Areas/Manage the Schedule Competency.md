# Manage the Schedule

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Manage the Schedule Competency

## Purpose of the Competency

- The purpose of this competency is to demonstrate the ability to achieve the goals of schedule management. These goals are to:
    
    - Determine realistic **timescales** for the work.
    
    - Calculate profiles of **resource demand** over time.
    
    - Present **schedule reports** in a format that is suitable for different stakeholders.

## Performance Criteria

- An individual must be able to demonstrate the ability to perform the following actions:

- **Plan and initiate schedule management**
    
    - This involves defining the approach, procedures, tools (e.g., scheduling software), and techniques that will be used to create and manage the schedule.
    
    - The output is typically a **schedule management plan**.

- **Identify the work that must be performed to achieve objectives**
    
    - This involves taking the defined scope (e.g., from a Product Breakdown Structure) and breaking it down into the individual activities required to create the deliverables.
    
    - The output of this is a **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** or an activity list.

- **Model the way work will be performed**
    
    - This involves sequencing the identified activities and defining the logical dependencies between them.
    
    - The most common tool for this is a **network diagram**, which shows what activities must be completed before others can begin.

- **Determine and apply suitable estimating methods for time and resource**
    
    - This involves estimating the duration of each activity and the resources required to complete it.
    
    - Suitable methods can range from simple expert judgement to more formal techniques like **analogous**, **parametric**, or **three-point estimating**.

- **Schedule the work**
    
    - This is the core calculation step. It involves using the model and estimates to perform an analysis (e.g., **Critical Path Analysis**) to calculate the start and finish dates for all activities.
    
    - It also includes applying resource constraints (**resource scheduling**) to create a realistic and achievable schedule.

- **Agree on schedules with stakeholders**
    - This involves communicating the resulting schedule to the relevant stakeholders, explaining the key milestones and critical path, and gaining their formal agreement and commitment to the baseline schedule.

- **Determine and apply suitable reporting methods**
    
    - This involves creating and presenting schedule information in formats appropriate for different audiences.
    
    - Examples include a high-level **milestone chart** for senior management, a detailed **Gantt chart** for the delivery team, or a **resource histogram** for a functional manager.

- **Assure the quality of schedule management**
    
    - This involves ensuring that the agreed-upon procedures for scheduling are being followed correctly.
    
    - It includes checking that estimates are sound, the model is logical, and the schedule is being regularly updated and controlled.

> [NOTE]  
> Scheduling approaches are closely linked to the context of the work. The performance criteria can be tailored to cover more complex situations, such as the consolidation of multiple schedules for a programme or the audit and approval of contractor schedules.

## Knowledge and Understanding

- An individual needs to know and understand the following principles and concepts:

- **The principles and goals of schedule management**
    - Understanding that a schedule is a dynamic model used to determine timescales, calculate resource demand, and communicate with stakeholders.

- **Responsibilities for schedule management**
    - Knowing who is responsible for what, including the role of the P3 manager (owns the schedule), the team (provides estimates), and planners/schedulers (provide specialist support).

- **The context of the work and its impact on managing the schedule**
    - Understanding how factors like complexity, uncertainty, and the delivery approach (e.g., traditional vs. agile) will influence the scheduling techniques used.

- **A procedure for schedule management**
    - Understanding the typical flow from identifying activities, to estimating, to modelling, to calculating, and then to controlling the schedule.

- **The purpose and content of schedule documentation**
    - Knowing the difference between various schedule documents and their purpose, such as a Work Breakdown Structure, a network diagram, a Gantt chart, and a milestone chart.

- **Techniques for identifying work components**
    - Understanding how to create a **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** to decompose the project scope into manageable activities.

- **Methods for modelling the performance of work**
    - Understanding how to create a **network diagram** that shows the logical dependencies between activities.

- **Time and resource estimating techniques**
    - Knowing various estimating techniques, such as:
        
        - **Analogous estimating** (using historical data from similar projects).
        
        - **Parametric estimating** (using a statistical relationship between historical data and other variables).
        
        - **Three-point estimating** (using optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely estimates to account for uncertainty).

- **Analysis techniques and reporting formats**
    
    - Understanding core analysis techniques like **Critical Path Analysis**, **resource smoothing**, and **resource levelling**.
    
    - Knowing how to present information in different formats like **Gantt charts**, **milestone charts**, and **resource histograms**.
    
    - Being aware of more sophisticated techniques where appropriate, such as **Monte Carlo analysis**, **Critical Chain**, or **Earned Value Management**.

- **The importance of maintaining and updating the schedule**
    - Understanding that a schedule is a living document that must be regularly updated with actual progress to be useful for forecasting and control.

- **How assurance applies to schedule management**
    - Understanding how to review the schedule to ensure it is realistic, based on sound logic and estimates, and is being managed according to the schedule management plan.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the three primary goals of schedule management?
    - **A:** 1. Determine timescales, 2. Calculate resource demand profiles, and 3. Present schedule reports suitable for different stakeholders.

- **Q:** What is the primary output of "identifying the work"?
    - **A:** A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) or activity list.

- **Q:** What is the most common tool for "modelling the way work will be performed"?
    - **A:** A network diagram.

- **Q:** What is the key difference between resource smoothing and resource levelling?
    - **A:** **Resource smoothing** tries to reduce peaks in resource demand without changing the project end date. **Resource levelling** ensures resource demand never exceeds availability, which usually means extending the project end date.

- **Q:** Name two different types of schedule reports suitable for different audiences.
    - **A:** A high-level milestone chart for senior management and a detailed Gantt chart for the delivery team.
