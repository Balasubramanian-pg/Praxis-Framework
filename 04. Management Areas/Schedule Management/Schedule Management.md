# Schedule Management

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Schedule Management Capability Maturity

## Overall Goal of Schedule Management

- The function of Schedule Management should:
    
    - Determine realistic timescales for the work.
    
    - Calculate profiles of resource demand over time.
    
    - Present schedule reports in a format that is suitable for different stakeholders.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Scheduling approaches are closely linked to the complexity of the work's scope. As complexity increases, more sophisticated techniques and multiple, consolidated schedules are required.  
> <br><br>  
> The maturity model reflects this progression. Level 2 represents an "adequate" approach, while Level 3 represents a more sophisticated and proactive approach that reduces risk and increases stakeholder satisfaction.

## Level 2 Capability Attributes

- At this level, scheduling is **performed and managed**, but it may be less sophisticated than it could be. It is often **reactive** and focuses primarily on the technical activities required to deliver outputs, sometimes neglecting the same level of rigour for management activities.

- **Identify Work**
    
    - The work required to deliver the objectives is identified and documented appropriately.
    
    - This is updated regularly, with a frequency that matches the scale and complexity of the work.

- **Time Scheduling**
    
    - Single or multiple models (schedules) are built that are **adequate** for the context and complexity of the work.
    
    - Time estimates are mainly **subjective** (based on expert opinion) and only **single-point estimates** are used.
    
    - The model is analysed using methods (e.g., basic Critical Path Analysis) that are adequate for the context.
    
    - Analyses are repeated periodically to reflect progress.

- **Resource Scheduling**
    
    - Resource estimates are mainly **subjective** and based on a general knowledge of the types of resources employed.
    
    - The model is analysed using methods (e.g., basic resource allocation) that are adequate for the context.
    
    - Analyses are repeated periodically to reflect progress.

- **Report**
    - **Standard reports** are distributed at regular intervals to stakeholders.

## Level 3 Capability Attributes

- At this level, scheduling is performed according to a **defined, standard process** that is tailored to the context. The approaches used are more than just adequate; they are sophisticated, proactive, and integrated across all types of work.

- **Identify Work**
    - In addition to the production activities, the activities required to **manage functions** (e.g., communications, risk responses, procurement) are identified and formally included in the scheduling model.

- **Time Scheduling**
    
    - Schedules are updated at **regular, frequent intervals** as the work is monitored and controlled.
    
    - All **technical and managerial activity** is included in the models.
    
    - Time estimates are based on **objective data** (e.g., historical data, metrics) wherever possible, rather than just subjective opinion.
    
    - Analyses are repeated not just to reflect progress but also to proactively test **"what-if" scenarios**.

- **Resource Scheduling**
    
    - Resource estimates are based on **objective data** wherever possible and on a specific, detailed knowledge of the resources to be employed.
    
    - The **influence of different resources** on the schedule (e.g., identifying critical resources or bottlenecks) is understood.
    
    - Analyses are repeated not just to reflect progress but also to proactively test **"what-if" scenarios** for resource allocation.

- **Report**
    - Stakeholders are regularly provided with schedule reports that are **tailored to their differing needs**, rather than receiving a single standard report.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is a key difference in the scope of work identified for scheduling between Level 2 and Level 3?
    - **A:** Level 2 focuses on the work required to deliver the objectives (production activities). Level 3 also formally identifies and includes the **activities required to manage functions** (e.g., communication, risk responses) in the schedule.

- **Q:** How do time and resource estimates differ between Level 2 and Level 3?
    - **A:** At Level 2, estimates are mainly **subjective** and based on single points. At Level 3, estimates are based on **objective data** wherever possible.

- **Q:** What proactive scheduling activity is performed at Level 3 that is not typical at Level 2?
    - **A:** The schedule model is used to test **"what-if" scenarios** to refine the schedule and solve issues before they happen.

- **Q:** How does reporting to stakeholders differ between Level 2 and Level 3?
    - **A:** At Level 2, **standard reports** are distributed at regular intervals. At Level 3, stakeholders are provided with reports that are **tailored to their specific needs**.
