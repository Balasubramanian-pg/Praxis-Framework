# Schedule Management

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Schedule Management

## General Principles of Schedule Management

- **Definition**: A schedule is a timetable showing the work involved in a project, programme, or portfolio. It is a dynamic document that is created and maintained throughout the life cycle.

- To be realistic, schedules must reflect the impact of **resource availability**, **risk**, and **estimating accuracy** on the performance of the work.

### The Goals of Schedule Management

- The primary goals of this function are to:
    
    1. Determine realistic **timescales** for the work.
    
    2. Calculate profiles of **resource demand** over time.
    
    3. Present schedule reports in a format that is suitable for different stakeholders.

### The Schedule Management Procedure

- The procedure for schedule management will vary with the context, but a typical high-level procedure includes the following steps:
    
    1. **Plan**: Define the techniques and approaches that will be used for scheduling (e.g., what software to use, how to estimate).
    
    2. **Initiate**: Ensure the necessary resources for scheduling (e.g., planners, software licenses) are acquired and mobilised.
    
    3. **Define Activities**: Identify and define the work that is needed to deliver the objectives, often based on the outputs of scope management.
    
    4. **Estimate Durations**: Estimate how long each activity will take.
    
    5. **Develop Schedule**: Sequence the activities, apply resources and constraints, and calculate the overall timeline.
    
    6. **Maintain Schedule**: Monitor progress against the schedule, update it with actuals, and re-forecast future dates as part of the control function.

## Key Concepts in Schedule Management

### Top-Down and Bottom-Up Approach

- Scheduling involves both top-down and bottom-up principles.
    
    - **Top-Down**: Within a portfolio or programme, work is first identified in large components (e.g., projects within a programme). This may identify top-level constraints (e.g., a deadline) that are passed down to the component projects.
    
    - **Bottom-Up**: Detailed scheduling based on analytical models is then conducted at the project level, and the results of this detailed work are fed back up to the high-level programme or portfolio schedule.

### The Relationship with the Triple Constraint

- Schedule management is concerned with the **time** aspect of the triple constraint. It is therefore closely inter-related with **scope management** (what to deliver) and **financial management** (the cost to deliver it).

- The relationship between these three elements dictates the scheduling approach:
    
    - **Traditional (e.g., construction)**: Scope is defined first, and the time and cost are derived from that defined scope.
    
    - **Agile**: Time (e.g., a sprint) and/or cost (e.g., the team size) may be the primary constraints, and the scope delivered is dependent upon the time and cost available.

### "What-If?" Scheduling

- Detailed schedule models can be used to test different theoretical scenarios. This is commonly called **"what-if?" scheduling**.

- **During Definition**: It can be used to test the schedule consequences of different solutions for achieving the objectives.

- **During Delivery**: It can be used to test the impact of alternative ways of creating an output or to model the schedule impact of a risk event occurring.

### Presenting Schedule Information

- By far the most common way of presenting schedule information is a form of bar chart known as a **Gantt chart**. This can range from a simple chart showing activities on a timescale to a more complex chart showing logical dependencies, resource usage, and progress information.

- Schedule reports must be tailored to the audience. A simple **milestone chart** may be appropriate for a senior executive, while a detailed Gantt chart is needed by the delivery team.

## Scheduling in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Projects

- Most detailed scheduling takes place at the project level, where the outputs are produced.

- **Rolling Wave Planning**: As the complexity of a project increases, it becomes impractical to maintain a single, highly detailed schedule for the entire life cycle. Large-scale projects will often use rolling wave planning, where only short-term work is shown in detail, with longer-term work being shown in summary until it gets closer.

- **Multiple Plans**: It may be useful to create separate delivery plans for different areas of work, such as a communications plan or a benefits realisation plan, in addition to the main product delivery schedule.

### Programmes

- At the programme level, there should be a high-level delivery plan that **summarises** the component plans of its projects and other activities.

- For this to be effective, the programme management team must ensure that **similar scheduling policies** are adopted across the entire programme. These policies would be set out in a programme-level schedule management plan.

- To avoid the top-level programme plan becoming cumbersome and unreadable, it will contain **summary activities** that may represent entire tranches or projects. It will also show key **milestones** extracted from the more detailed plans.

### Portfolios

- The greatest diversity of planning information exists in a portfolio. Portfolio plans need to be presented in a way that enables stakeholders to understand what information is derived from detailed, bottom-up schedules and what is more speculative or based on high-level estimates.

- **Capacity Planning**: An important aspect of portfolio management is capacity planning. This ensures that the necessary resources can be procured to deliver the portfolio and helps to avoid bottlenecks and conflicting demands on limited resources.

- For capacity planning to be accurate, the component project and programme schedules must be consistent in the way they estimate activities and allocate resources so that the aggregation of resource demand at the portfolio level is accurate and meaningful.

- The portfolio management process must continuously balance changing resource demands and prioritise the allocation of limited resources, all of which depends on accurate and timely schedule information aggregated from the component projects and programmes.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the three main goals of schedule management?
    - **A:** 1. To determine timescales for the work, 2. To calculate profiles of resource demand, and 3. To present schedule reports in a format suitable for different stakeholders.

- **Q:** What is the difference in how traditional and agile approaches treat the triple constraint?
    - **A:** In a **traditional** approach, scope is fixed, and time and cost are derived. In an **agile** approach, time and cost are often fixed (e.g., a sprint with a fixed team), and the scope delivered is variable.

- **Q:** What is "what-if?" scheduling?
    - **A:** Using a schedule model to test theoretical scenarios, such as the impact of a risk event or an alternative way of delivering the work.

- **Q:** What is "rolling wave planning"?
    - **A:** A technique used on large projects and programmes where short-term work is planned in detail, while longer-term work is planned in summary until it gets closer.

- **Q:** What is "capacity planning" and why is it important at the portfolio level?
    - **A:** It is the process of ensuring that the necessary resources can be procured to deliver the portfolio. It is important for avoiding resource bottlenecks and conflicting demands across the entire organisation.
