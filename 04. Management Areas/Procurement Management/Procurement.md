# Comprehensive Study Notes: Procurement

## General Principles of Procurement

- **Definition**: Procurement covers the acquisition from a supplier of the products and services required for the completion of a project, programme, or portfolio.

### The Goals of Procurement

- The primary goals of this function are to:
    
    1. Identify potential **external suppliers**.
    
    2. Select the most appropriate **external suppliers**.
    
    3. Obtain firm commitment for the provision of **internal resources**.

### Internal vs. External Sources

- An **external source** represents any supplier from outside the host organisation. The terms are typically governed by a legal **contract**.

- An **internal source** represents a department or division within the host organisation. The terms are typically governed by a less formal **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** or Terms of Reference.

- Procurement typically includes the acquisition of:
    
    - ‘Off the shelf’ goods and services.
    
    - Bespoke goods or services designed specifically for the purchaser.
    
    - Specialist advice or consultancy.

## The Procurement Procedure

1. **Plan**:
    - This initial step is documented in the **resource management plan** and defines the procurement strategy.

2. **Research Suppliers**:
    
    - This involves identifying suppliers that have the required capability. This may result in a long list of potential suppliers.
    
    - The host organisation may have a pre-approved supplier list that reduces the work needed here.

3. **Pre-qualify Suppliers**:
    
    - This step aims to reduce the long list to a manageable **shortlist**.
    
    - This can be achieved through methods like a pre-qualification questionnaire, which clarifies the supplier's capacity, financial stability, and technical experience.
    
    - Experience of the same suppliers from other projects or programmes should be researched, ideally through a formal knowledge management system or by speaking to other managers.

4. **Select Supplier**:
    
    - The shortlisted suppliers are asked to provide a full bid against a defined **Statement of Work**.
    
    - Final selection is often based on a formal **tender** process. This can be an extensive procedure, and a P3 manager may need to seek specialist help.
    
    - The requirements must be clear, and all suppliers must be given an equal and fair chance of success.
    
    - Selection should include an appropriate risk analysis in addition to cost, time, and quality considerations.

5. **Award Contract**:
    - This step involves the final negotiation and agreement of a formal contract.

> [CAUTION]  
> Throughout the procurement procedure, care must be taken to ensure that a contract is not entered into casually. It should be made clear in all meetings and documents that the proceedings are "subject to contract" until a formal agreement is signed. Procurement records must be carefully maintained to mitigate the risk of unsuccessful suppliers challenging the decision.

## Key Concepts in Procurement

### Acquiring Internal Resources

- The acquisition of internal resources is often not seen as a formal procurement exercise.

- This makes it inherently more risky because the P3 manager may be relying on verbal, non-binding commitments from departmental managers.

- While tendering and legal contracts are not appropriate, the P3 manager must take steps to **formalise the relationship** with internal suppliers. This could be a written confirmation or a more formal SLA.

- The **sponsor** should be involved in negotiating these agreements to provide seniority if there are issues of non-performance later.

### Package Breakdown Structure

- A **package breakdown structure**, based on the WBS or PBS, shows how the work will be arranged in order to procure packages from different suppliers.

- The allocation of work to these packages is an important mechanism for managing risk.

- For each package, the relative importance of time, cost, and quality needs to be considered, as this will greatly influence how contract incentives or service levels are designed.

## Procurement in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Small Projects

- Smaller stand-alone projects will not be able to justify a dedicated procurement infrastructure. They should use the specialist services of the host organisation (e.g., a central purchasing department).

- **Early Procurement**: The project manager must consider procurement implications as early in the life cycle as is practicable. Waiting until full approval at the end of the definition process may result in tender delays and long lead times that adversely affect the schedule. This early procurement is covered by the **"pre-authorisation work"** activity.

- Managers of small projects will have less opportunity to develop long-term relationships with suppliers. In such situations, procurement needs to ensure the mechanisms for supply are as routine and low-risk as possible.

### Programmes

- The programme management team must decide which suppliers are to be managed at the project level and which are to be managed centrally at the programme level.

- The programme team should consider consolidating procurement for:
    
    - Suppliers providing goods or services to **multiple projects**.
    
    - High-risk or specialist contracts that need particular procurement expertise.

- This allows for **economies of scale** through pan-programme procurement.

### Portfolios, Programmes, and Large Projects

- At these larger scales, the management team can make use of more strategic procurement approaches:
    
    - **Partnering and Alliancing**: Creating long-term, collaborative relationships with key suppliers.
    
    - **Framework Contracts**: These are agreements that set out terms and conditions, including unit prices, for goods and services that can then be "called off" by individual projects as needed. This greatly reduces the procurement effort required at the lower levels.

- Framework contracts are not appropriate for all goods and services. There will still be many specialist suppliers who have to be selected locally to meet the specific needs of individual projects.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the three primary goals of procurement?
    - **A:** 1. To identify potential external suppliers, 2. To select external suppliers, and 3. To obtain commitment for the provision of internal resources.

- **Q:** What is the difference in how external and internal suppliers are typically engaged?
    - **A:** External suppliers are engaged through a formal legal **contract**. Internal suppliers (departments) are engaged through a less formal **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** or Terms of Reference.

- **Q:** What is the purpose of a pre-qualification exercise?
    - **A:** To reduce a long list of potential suppliers down to a manageable shortlist who will be invited to submit a full tender.

- **Q:** Why is it risky to rely on informal, verbal agreements for internal resources?
    - **A:** Because the P3 manager has no real control over whether the right resources will be available at the right time, as departmental priorities can change without notice.

- **Q:** What is a "framework contract"?
    - **A:** A long-term agreement with a supplier that sets out terms and unit prices, allowing individual projects to "call off" goods and services as needed without going through a full procurement process each time.
