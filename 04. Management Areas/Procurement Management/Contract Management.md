# Comprehensive Study Notes: Contract Management

## General Principles of Contract Management

- **Definition**: Contract management includes the negotiation, creation, and ongoing administration of a legally binding contract between two or more parties.

### The Goals of Contract Management

- The primary goals of this function are to:
    
    1. Support the **procurement** process by negotiating the terms and conditions.
    
    2. Formally **document** the contractual agreements.
    
    3. **Monitor** the contractual performance of all parties.
    
    4. Formally **conclude** contracts at the end of the work.

## The Contract Management Procedure

1. **Plan and Initiate**:
    
    - This step defines the scope and objectives of contract management.
    
    - Unless contract management is a major function within the work, it is likely that these steps will be part of a broader **resource management** procedure and plan.

2. **Negotiate Contract**:
    - This is the first specific step, where the contract terms are negotiated with the selected supplier.

3. **Create Contract**:
    - A formal contract document is created, setting out the obligations of all parties.

4. **Administer Contract**:
    - This is the ongoing process of managing the contract throughout its life, monitoring performance, and managing payments and changes.

5. **Conclude Contract**:
    - Once the work is complete, this step confirms that all legal obligations under the contract have been discharged.

## The Nature of a Contract

- A contract is an agreement made between two or more parties that creates **legally binding obligations** between them. It sets out those obligations and the actions that can be taken if they are not met.

- Contracts are covered by **contract law**, and specialist legal advice should be sought to ensure the ramifications of any proposed contract are fully understood.

### Universal Principles of a Contract

- While laws vary by jurisdiction, there are general principles that are universal. For a contract to be valid, there must be:
    
    - An **offer** made by one party, which is **accepted** by the other party without qualification.
    
    - An **intention** to create a legal relationship.
    
    - **Consideration** passing from one party to the other (e.g., payment in return for goods/services).
    
    - **Clear and definite terms**.
    
    - **Legality** of the agreement and competence of the parties entering into it.

### Standard vs. Bespoke Contracts

- **Standard Forms of Contract**:
    
    - Many industries have standard forms of contract (e.g., NEC3 for construction).
    
    - **Advantage**: They take account of established best practice within that industry.
    
    - **Disadvantage**: They may not fully address all the specific risk-sharing or payment requirements for a particular project.

- **Bespoke Contracts**:
    
    - These are contracts that are built from scratch to reflect the specific context and content of the work.
    
    - They are more flexible but require more legal expertise to create.

### Typical Contract Content

- Whether standard or bespoke, all contracts typically contain similar information, such as:
    
    - A description of the works or services.
    
    - The legal system that the contract will use.
    
    - Responsibilities for design, approvals, and subcontracting.
    
    - Agreed milestones and the completion date.
    
    - Procedures for **change control**, **quality control**, and **testing**.
    
    - **Payment methods** and procedures.
    
    - Clauses on **risk transfer** and **risk sharing**.
    
    - Ownership of assets and **Intellectual Property (IP)**.
    
    - **Dispute management** procedures.

## Administering the Contract

### The Contract as a Tool

- If all parties perform as expected, it will not be necessary to resort to the contract to resolve a dispute.

- However, when performance falls short, the contract can become a tool in **conflict management** and resolution.

- The P3 manager should not immediately resort to the "letter of the law." They must approach contractual conflict in a measured way, weighing the impact of destroying the relationship with the supplier against the benefits of resolving the dispute in other ways.

> [WARNING]  
> The P3 manager must ensure their team is aware of how contractual obligations can be created inadvertently by poorly worded communications or inappropriate actions. Case law has confirmed that changes to a contract can be made without formal legal instructions being issued.

### Concluding the Contract

- Once the contract is concluded, the P3 manager must confirm that all legal obligations have been discharged.

- Items such as equipment **warranties** and **defect liabilities** may need to be administered for months or even years after the contract is formally concluded.

- The responsibilities for administering these long-term liabilities need to be considered and documented, often in a **follow-on actions report**.

## Contract Management in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Projects

- Smaller, non-complex projects, or work performed entirely using internal resources, may have no formal contracts at all.

- For more complex internal relationships, a **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** may be used, which can adopt many of the principles of a formal contract.

- As complexity increases, the P3 manager will need support from **procurement specialists** and, for unusual or complex legal issues, **contract lawyers**.

### Programmes, Portfolios, and Large Projects

- At these larger scales, co-ordination is needed between multiple contracts.

- **Framework Contracts**: The work will often be best served by framework contracts with key suppliers. These cover multiple projects, avoiding the need for separately negotiated contracts for each small package of work.

- **Interdependencies**: The P3 manager must understand the interdependencies between multiple contracts. The actions (or inactions) of one supplier may adversely affect another, leading to a contractual dispute. All such interdependencies should be considered, and the contracts should be drafted accordingly to manage these risks.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is a contract?
    - **A:** An agreement between two or more parties that creates legally binding obligations.

- **Q:** Name three universal principles required for a contract to be valid.
    - **A:** Any three from: Offer and acceptance, intention to create a legal relationship, consideration, clear terms, and legality.

- **Q:** What is the difference between a standard and a bespoke contract?
    - **A:** A **standard contract** is a pre-existing form for a specific industry (e.g., NEC3). A **bespoke contract** is written from scratch to meet the specific needs of the work.

- **Q:** How can contractual obligations be created inadvertently?
    - **A:** Through poorly worded communications or inappropriate actions that are later deemed by a court to have constituted a binding agreement or a change to an existing one.

- **Q:** In a programme with multiple suppliers, what is a key contractual risk the programme manager must consider?
    - **A:** The interdependencies between the contracts. The actions of one supplier may adversely affect another, leading to a contractual dispute. The contracts should be drafted to manage this risk.
