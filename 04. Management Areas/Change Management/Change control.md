# Comprehensive Study Notes: Change Control

## General Principles of Change Control

- **Definition**: Change control is the formal process by which all requests to change a baselined scope are captured, evaluated, and then either approved or rejected.

### The Goals of Change Control

- The primary goals of this function are to:
    
    1. Capture stakeholders’ requests to make changes to the baselined scope.
    
    2. Ensure that change requests are only approved if they are **viable and achievable**.
    
    3. Integrate approved changes into the existing scope in a controlled manner.

> [IMPORTANT]  
> Where scope is well defined early in the life cycle, it is essential for success that any subsequent changes to the approved baselines are rigorously controlled. A formal change control procedure must be established and maintained.

## The Change Control Procedure

1. **Plan**:
    
    - This step defines how the management team will work with stakeholders to handle changes, which can be a significant source of conflict.
    
    - The plan may set limits on the amount of change permissible and must integrate closely with stakeholder management.
    
    - It may even define which stakeholders are allowed to submit requests.

2. **Initiate**:
    
    - This step ensures that the resources needed to manage the change control process are mobilised.
    
    - This sometimes requires the appointment of a formal body called the **Change Control Authority** (or Change Control Board) to ensure that requests are properly assessed and that the procedure is seen to be open and fair.

3. **Request Change**:
    
    - The procedure is triggered when a stakeholder makes a formal change request, providing relevant information about the nature of the change.
    
    - The request is entered into a **change log**, which records all requests and their current status (e.g., pending, approved, rejected, deferred).

4. **Review Change**:
    
    - The change request is first reviewed at a high level to determine its impact on outputs, outcomes, and benefits.
    
    - If necessary, further clarification may be sought from the requester.
    
    - Based on this initial review, a decision is made on whether it is worthwhile to perform a detailed assessment. The request may be rejected at this point.

5. **Assess Change**:
    
    - If a full assessment is justified, all options relating to the change are captured and evaluated. The detailed impact on the delivery plans (scope, schedule, cost, risk, etc.) is assessed.
    
    - To be accepted, a proposed change should be:
        
        - **Beneficial**: It has a positive impact on the business case or provides some other advantage, such as reducing risk.
        
        - **Practical**: It will work in the context of the existing specification and any other changes.
        
        - **Affordable**: Funds are available to pay for the change, perhaps from a dedicated change budget or a management reserve.

6. **Decide Change**:
    
    - Based on the detailed assessment, a recommendation to approve, reject, defer, or request more information is made.
    
    - Pre-defined thresholds will determine who has the authority to make the final decision (e.g., the P3 manager, the sponsor, or the Change Control Authority).

7. **Implement Change**:
    
    - The decision is communicated to the management team and stakeholders.
    
    - If the change is approved, the relevant delivery plans are updated, and the changes are made to existing products or to the specifications for future products.
    
    - Any approved changes must be fed back into the **configuration management** system.

> [NOTE]  
> There is always the possibility that urgent changes are imposed or pushed through without due process. These should always be retrospectively put through the change control procedure to ensure their impact is properly documented and assessed.

## Change Control in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Projects

- Most change requests relate to the products that make up a project's output.

- Approved changes usually have cost implications, and ideally, funds will have been set aside in the project's **change budget** to cover this.

- If the work is predicted to exceed the change budget, the project manager must escalate this issue to the sponsor.

- **Contractual Terms**: The contract with a supplier can have a significant impact on change control. Some payment methods (e.g., firm fixed price) may not allow any change to the contracted specification, while others will have a pre-determined schedule of payments for authorised changes.

- **Agile Projects**: Agile projects take a very different approach. They make change an integral part of the development process. Each iteration (sprint) starts with a planning meeting that clarifies and prioritises the work for that iteration. Some of this work may be changes to existing features, but these are considered alongside all the other requirements.

### Programmes

- Change control at the programme level is concerned with changes that relate to **benefits**. This can be because a change request is directly aimed at a benefit profile or because of the indirect effect of project-level changes on the programme's benefits.

- The procedure will first assess the impact of a change request on the programme's benefits and then assess the knock-on impact on the component projects.

- **Interdependencies**: The programme management team must be very aware of the complexity of interdependencies. Some change requests within one project may have significant knock-on effects on other projects. The programme team must manage these cross-project impacts.

### Portfolios

- A structured portfolio's objectives are dependent upon the **corporate strategy**. If the strategy changes to reflect a changing commercial environment, the portfolio must respond accordingly.

- The change control procedure doesn’t really apply to "change requests" that emanate from corporate strategy in terms of deciding whether to accept or reject them—the portfolio _must_ accept them.

- However, these strategic changes still need to be formally **assessed** for their implications on the objectives of the component projects and programmes within the portfolio.

- Instead of simply approving or rejecting a change request, the portfolio version of the procedure may result in the **reprioritisation**, or even the **cancellation**, of some projects or programmes and the identification and initiation of new ones to align with the new strategy.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the three primary goals of change control?
    - **A:** 1. To capture change requests, 2. To ensure only viable and achievable requests are approved, and 3. To integrate approved changes into the existing scope.

- **Q:** What three criteria should an accepted change request meet?
    - **A:** It should be beneficial, practical, and affordable.

- **Q:** What is the "change log" used for?
    - **A:** To record all change requests and track their current status (e.g., pending, approved, rejected, deferred).

- **Q:** How does change control differ in an agile project compared to a traditional one?
    - **A:** In a traditional project, change control is a formal process to limit changes to a fixed baseline. In an agile project, change is an integral part of the development process and is handled within each iteration's planning.

- **Q:** How does change control at the portfolio level differ from the project or programme level?
    - **A:** At the portfolio level, it's less about approving/rejecting change requests and more about assessing the impact of changes in corporate strategy. This assessment may lead to the reprioritisation, cancellation, or initiation of projects and programmes to realign the portfolio with the new strategy.
