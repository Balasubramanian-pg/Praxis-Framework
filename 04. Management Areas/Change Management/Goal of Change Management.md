# Change Management

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Change Management

## General Principles of Change Management

- **Definition**: The achievement of benefits in a business case often requires changes to the working practices of the host organisation. These new working practices are known as **outcomes**. Moving from the current way of working to the desired future outcome is achieved through **change management**.

- Outcomes usually include a section of the organisation adopting and utilising the outputs of one or more projects.

### The Goals of Change Management

- The primary goals of this function are to:
    
    1. Define the **organisational change** required to convert project outputs into business benefits.
    
    2. Ensure the organisation is **prepared** to implement the change.
    
    3. **Implement** the change and **embed** it into normal organisational practice.

### Understanding and Managing Resistance to Change

- Organisations and individuals respond to change in many different ways. **Resistance to change is a natural phenomenon**.

- Managing this change in a controlled and empathetic manner is essential if the benefits promised in the business case are to be realised.

- One way of understanding how an organisation may react to change is through metaphors. Gareth Morgan identified eight metaphors that liken an organisation to, for example, machines (rigid, process-driven), brains (learning, adaptive), or organisms (responsive to the environment).

- Different change management models (e.g., from Kotter, Carnall, or Lewin) are often appropriate for different types of organisational metaphors.

## The Change Management Procedure

1. **Plan**:
    
    - This step produces the **change management plan**, which defines the principles of how organisational change should be managed.
    
    - Since change is both central to achieving benefits and one of the hardest things to manage well, this is a key document. It must be closely aligned with other management plans, such as those for stakeholder management and risk management.

2. **Initiate**:
    - This step ensures that the resources needed to manage change, such as Business Change Managers (BCMs), are in place.

3. **Assess Readiness**:
    
    - This involves determining the nature of the organisation and predicting its likely response to the proposed change.
    
    - Existing embedded behaviours are considered, along with the organisation’s readiness and willingness to implement the change.

4. **Prepare for Change**:
    
    - This involves promoting a clear vision for the future and gaining support for it.
    
    - This work normally forms part of the **identification and definition processes** of a project or programme, where stakeholder management is used to gain support for the high-level business case.
    
    - It also includes establishing the governance and roles to support the change, such as the appointment of BCMs.

5. **Implement Change**:
    - This is the heart of the procedure. It includes communicating and promoting the benefits of the change, removing obstacles, and co-ordinating the activities that transform business-as-usual from the current practices to the required outcomes.

6. **Sustain Change**:
    
    - For changes to deliver their full benefits, they have to be **embedded**—they must become stable and the normal way of working.
    
    - This step will often continue well beyond the P3 life cycle to ensure that value is continually realised from the investment.

### The "Formula for Change"

- The organisation's readiness for change is a key factor in the success of the "Implement" step. This readiness can be represented by a simple formula:
    
    **C = (A x B x D) > X**
    
    - **C** is the likely success of the change.
    
    - **A** is the level of **dissatisfaction** with the current situation.
    
    - **B** is the **desirability** of the proposed change (the vision for the future).
    
    - **D** is the **practicality** of the proposed change (the first concrete steps).
    
    - **X** is the perceived cost of the change (financial, emotional, etc.).

- The more the combination of A, B, and D exceeds the cost of the change (X), the more likely it is that the change will succeed. If any of A, B, or D is zero, the product is zero, and the change will fail.

## Change Management in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Projects vs. Programmes

- The inclusion of significant change management is often seen as the deciding factor in whether work should be considered a project or a programme.

- Many sources claim that projects only deliver outputs and that any work involving change management to realise benefits _must_ be a programme.

- However, reality is rarely that simple.
    
    - A piece of work that delivers a **single output**, leading to **small-scale change** and a resultant benefit, is probably best considered to be a **project** (with an extended life cycle).
    
    - Work that covers **multiple outputs, complex change**, and numerous different benefits is undoubtedly a **programme**.
    
    - There is no absolute, set point of distinction between the two.

### Programmes

- A characteristic of a complex programme is that it is not easy to predict all the necessary change at the outset. The concepts of a **vision** and a **blueprint** form an essential part of the "assess" and "prepare" steps of the procedure, with detailed change management plans evolving with the programme.

- **"Islands of Stability"**: A frequent obstacle to change arises from the sheer volume of change imposed on individuals or business units from multiple sources. The programme management team should structure the **tranches** of the programme and co-ordinate the project schedules to ensure that change comes in manageable pieces, interspersed with periods of stability.

### Portfolios

- **Standard Portfolios**: These are not normally focused on a co-ordinated set of benefits and may not include any change management at all (e.g., a construction company’s portfolio of unrelated client contracts).

- **Structured Portfolios**: A structured portfolio involves **co-ordinating the change management plans** of all its component projects and programmes to ensure that they work together effectively.

- The portfolio team must be aware of the cumulative impact of change on the organisation. For example, if multiple projects and programmes are imposing change on a single business unit simultaneously, this can have a negative effect, either because the unit cannot accommodate that level of change or because the multiple changes conflict with each other. The portfolio team is responsible for managing this overall "change capacity".

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is an "outcome" in the context of change management?
    - **A:** The new working practices that an organisation adopts and utilises as a result of a change.

- **Q:** What are the three primary goals of change management?
    - **A:** 1. Define the required organisational change, 2. Ensure the organisation is prepared for the change, and 3. Implement and embed the change into practice.

- **Q:** What is the "formula for change" and what does it represent?
    - **A:** C = (A x B x D) > X. It represents the idea that the success of a change (C) depends on the combination of Dissatisfaction with the present (A), Desirability of the future (B), and the Practicality of the first steps (D) being greater than the perceived Cost of the change (X).

- **Q:** Is change management exclusively a programme management function?
    - **A:** No. While it is a defining characteristic of programmes, a simple project delivering a single output that requires small-scale change can also include change management as part of an extended project life cycle.

- **Q:** What is the key change management role of a structured portfolio?
    - **A:** To co-ordinate the change management plans of all its component projects and programmes to manage the overall "change capacity" of the organisation and ensure the cumulative impact of change on business units is manageable.
