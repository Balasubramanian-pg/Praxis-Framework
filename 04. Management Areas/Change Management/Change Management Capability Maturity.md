# Change Management

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Change Management Capability Maturity

## Overall Goal of Change Management

- The function of Change Management should:
    
    - Define the organisational change required to convert project outputs into business benefits.
    
    - Ensure the organisation is prepared to implement the change.
    
    - Implement the change and embed it into normal organisational practice.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Capability in change management cannot be achieved by the P3 organisation alone. By its very nature, it inevitably involves people in business-as-usual who do not regard themselves as part of the project or programme.  
> <br><br>  
> The required level of capability depends on the context:
> 
> - **Level 2** is likely to be sufficient for projects implementing non-complex change.
> 
> - **Level 3** is an important goal for programmes with complex change objectives.

## Level 2 Capability Attributes

- At this level, change management is **performed and managed**. The basic steps are followed, but the approach may be more reactive and less tailored to the specific culture of the organisation.

- **Assess**
    - The areas of the organisation that are subject to change are assessed for their **readiness to change**.

- **Prepare**
    
    - Change plans are **communicated** to affected groups.
    
    - Stakeholders are **influenced** to gain their support for the change.

- **Implement**
    
    - The change is implemented in accordance with the organisation’s readiness and the change plans.
    
    - Progress of the change implementation is **monitored and communicated**.

- **Sustain**
    - Representatives of the organisational areas that have changed (e.g., Business Change Managers) are assigned the **responsibility for supporting and maintaining** the new management processes and behaviours after the initial implementation.

## Level 3 Capability Attributes

- At this level, change management is performed according to a **defined, standard process** that is highly tailored to the context. The approach is proactive, empathetic, and integrated with the organisation's overall control systems.

- **Assess**
    
    - The **underlying characteristics of the organisation** (e.g., its culture, power structures, history with change) are assessed.
    
    - Based on this assessment, the likely reaction to the change is actively **predicted**.

- **Prepare**
    - The preparation for the change is **clearly sensitive to the characteristics of the organisation** and takes the predicted responses into account in its strategy.

- **Implement**
    
    - Individuals affected by the change are actively **supported** (e.g., through coaching, training, and open communication channels).
    
    - The approach to implementing the change is **amended as work proceeds** based on feedback and observed reactions.
    
    - There are **clear links between the control systems** within the project/programme and the control systems within the organisational area subject to change, ensuring alignment.

- **Sustain**
    
    - Formal **plans exist describing how the change will be supported** until it is deemed to be fully embedded in business-as-usual.
    
    - The **effectiveness of the change** is periodically assessed alongside, and as part of, **benefits realisation** reviews, creating a direct link between the two.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** Who must be involved for an organisation to achieve capability in change management, aside from the P3 team?
    - **A:** People in **business-as-usual**, as they are the ones who must adopt the change.

- **Q:** What is the key difference in the "Assess" step between Level 2 and Level 3?
    - **A:** At Level 2, readiness is assessed. At Level 3, the **underlying characteristics of the organisation** are assessed, and its likely reaction to the change is **predicted**.

- **Q:** How does the "Implement" step at Level 3 show a more mature approach than at Level 2?
    - **A:** At Level 3, individuals are actively **supported**, the approach is **amended** based on feedback, and there are clear links between the project's and the business's control systems.

- **Q:** At Level 3, what is the "Sustain" step closely linked to?
    - **A:** The effectiveness of the change is periodically assessed alongside **benefits realisation** reviews.

- **Q:** At Level 3, how is the preparation for change tailored?
    - **A:** The preparation is **clearly sensitive to the characteristics of the organisation** and takes the predicted responses to the change into account.
