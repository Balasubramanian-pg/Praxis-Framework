# Scope Document

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Scope Documents

## General Principles of Scope Documents

- **Definition**: Scope documents are the collection of documents that collectively describe the **objectives of the work**. They define what the project, programme, or portfolio is intended to achieve and deliver.

## The Two Main Types of Scope Documents

- Praxis distinguishes between two main types of scope documents. The distinction is based on whether the document's content can be standardised or if it is entirely dependent on the specific technical nature of the work.

### 1. Standard (Environment-Independent) Documents

- **Definition**: These are documents for which it is possible to define a **standard structure and content** that is largely independent of the specific industry or technical environment.

- **Praxis Role**: For these documents, Praxis can provide detailed descriptions and templates because their purpose and content are universal across most P3 initiatives.

- **Focus**: They typically focus on the "why" and the "value" of the work.

- **Examples**:
    
    - **Business Case**: Explains the justification for the work (desirability, achievability, viability). Its structure is consistent whether the project is for software, construction, or business change.
    
    - **Benefit Profile**: Details a specific benefit, how it will be measured, and who is responsible for its realisation. This format is applicable across different types of programmes and projects.

### 2. Technical (Environment-Dependent) Documents

- **Definition**: These are documents whose content is **entirely dependent upon the technical nature of the work** being undertaken.

- **Praxis Role**: Because their content is so specific to the industry and technology, Praxis **cannot define any detail** for these documents. Instead, Praxis simply describes _what is to be achieved_ by the document—its purpose and role within the P3 management framework. The detailed content must be created by technical experts.

- **Focus**: They typically focus on the technical "what" and "how" of the deliverables.

- **Example**:
    - **Specification**: This is the primary example. The purpose of a specification is always to describe a deliverable in detail. However, the content of a specification for a new software application will be completely different from the specification for a new bridge or a pharmaceutical drug. Therefore, no single template could possibly cover all contexts.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is the primary purpose of a scope document?
    - **A:** To describe the objectives of the work in terms of outputs, outcomes, and benefits.

- **Q:** What are the two main types of scope documents as distinguished by Praxis?
    - **A:** Standard (environment-independent) documents and Technical (environment-dependent) documents.

- **Q:** Give an example of a standard, environment-independent scope document for which Praxis can provide a template.
    - **A:** A business case or a benefit profile.

- **Q:** Why can't Praxis provide a detailed, standard template for a "specification"?
    - **A:** Because its content is entirely dependent upon the specific technical nature of the work (e.g., software vs. construction). Praxis can only define its purpose, not its detailed content.
