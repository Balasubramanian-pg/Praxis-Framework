# Manage Scope

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Manage Scope Competency

## Purpose of the Competency

- The purpose of this competency is to demonstrate the ability to achieve the goals of scope management. These goals are to:
    
    - Identify stakeholder wants and needs.
    
    - Specify the outputs, outcomes, and benefits that meet agreed requirements.
    
    - Maintain and control the scope throughout the life cycle.

> [!NOTE]  
> Scope is the primary factor in deciding whether to manage work as a project or a programme. A competent individual can manage scope appropriately, whether it's a simple, well-defined project output or a complex programme with multiple benefits and organisational changes.

## Performance Criteria

- An individual must be able to demonstrate the ability to perform the following actions:

- **Plan and initiate scope management**
    
    - This involves defining the approach, procedures, tools, and techniques that will be used to manage all aspects of scope (requirements, solutions, benefits, change, and configuration).
    
    - It includes creating the scope management plan and any related plans (e.g., benefits management plan, change control plan) that set the "rules" for the project or programme.

- **Work with stakeholders to determine and agree on scope**
    
    - This is the practical application of requirements management.
    
    - It involves using techniques like workshops, interviews, and surveys to capture stakeholder wants and needs, and then facilitating a consensus to establish a single, viable set of objectives.

- **Accurately document, baseline, and communicate scope**
    
    - This involves translating the agreed requirements into formal scope documents (e.g., a specification, blueprint, or benefit profiles).
    
    - "Baselining" means formally approving these documents as the definitive version against which all future work and changes will be measured.
    
    - The baselined scope must then be clearly communicated to all relevant stakeholders.

- **Monitor work and ensure it accords with the agreed scope**
    
    - This is an ongoing control activity.
    
    - It involves checking that the work being performed by the delivery teams is aligned with the baselined scope and that there is no "scope creep" (unauthorised additions to the scope).
    
    - This is closely linked to quality control and verification activities.

- **Control changes and maintain scope documentation**
    
    - This is the practical application of the change control and configuration management procedures.
    
    - It involves managing all formal requests to change the baselined scope, ensuring they are properly assessed for their impact on the business case, and documenting all decisions.
    
    - It also includes updating all relevant scope and delivery documents to reflect any approved changes.

- **Assure the quality of scope management**
    
    - This involves ensuring that the agreed-upon procedures for managing scope are being followed correctly by the team.
    
    - It includes checking that requirements are properly traced, changes are being controlled, and configurations are being managed according to the plan.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This competency summarises several others (e.g., Manage Requirements, Manage Benefits). The specific knowledge criteria required will need to be adjusted based on the context. For example, a project manager on a simple project may not need deep knowledge of benefits management, as this might be handled by a parent programme.

## Knowledge and Understanding

- An individual needs to know and understand the following principles and concepts:

- **The principles and goals of scope management**
    - Understanding that scope is the totality of outputs, outcomes, and benefits and that the goal is to define this scope clearly and control it effectively throughout the life cycle.

- **Responsibilities for scope management**
    - Knowing who is responsible for what, including the role of the sponsor (owns the business case), the P3 manager (manages scope day-to-day), business analysts (capture requirements), and the Change Control Authority (approves changes).

- **The context of the work and its impact on managing scope**
    
    - Understanding how factors like complexity, uncertainty, and the industry (e.g., construction vs. IT) will impact the approach to scope management.
    
    - This includes knowing when a predictive (waterfall) approach with rigid change control is appropriate versus when an adaptive (agile) approach with evolving scope is needed.

- **An overall procedure for managing scope**
    - Understanding the typical flow from identifying requirements, to developing solutions, to baselining the scope, and then managing changes against that baseline.

- **The purpose and content of key scope documentation**
    - Knowing what the key scope documents are and what they are used for, such as:
        
        - **Specification**: A detailed description of an output.
        
        - **Blueprint**: A detailed model of the future state of the organisation for a programme.
        
        - **Benefit Profile**: A document detailing a single benefit and how it will be measured.
        
        - **Product/Work Breakdown Structures (PBS/WBS)**: Hierarchical decompositions of the work to be done.

- **The principles of requirements management and solution development**
    
    - Understanding how to capture, analyse, and baseline stakeholder wants and needs ("solution-free" requirements).
    
    - Understanding how to then evaluate different technical options and develop a specification for the optimal solution to meet those requirements.

- **The principles of benefits management**
    
    - Understanding the process of identifying, quantifying, and valuing benefits and dis-benefits.
    
    - Knowing how to plan for their realisation, which involves managing the necessary organisational changes.

- **The principles of change control and configuration management**
    
    - **Change Control**: Understanding the formal process for capturing, assessing, and approving or rejecting any requested changes to the baselined scope.
    
    - **Configuration Management**: Understanding the process for identifying, tracking, and controlling the versions of all products (configuration items) throughout their development.

- **How assurance applies to scope management**
    - Understanding how to check that the agreed policies and procedures for managing all aspects of scope are being followed correctly.

> [!WARNING]  
> One of the most common causes of project failure is an inability to manage scope effectively. This can manifest as poorly defined requirements at the start ("scope definition failure") or uncontrolled changes during delivery ("scope creep"). This competency is therefore critical to success.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the three primary goals of scope management?
    - **A:** 1. Identify stakeholder wants and needs; 2. Specify outputs, outcomes, and benefits; 3. Maintain and control scope throughout the life cycle.

- **Q:** What is the difference between "verification" and "validation" in scope management?
    - **A:** **Verification** checks if the product is being built right (i.e., it meets its specification). **Validation** checks if the right product is being built (i.e., it still meets the stakeholder's underlying requirement and the business case).

- **Q:** What is the difference between "change control" and "change management"?
    - **A:** **Change control** is the process for managing changes to the project's _scope_. **Change management** is the process of managing the organisational and people-side of change to embed new working practices and realise benefits.

- **Q:** What does it mean to "baseline" the scope?
    - **A:** It means to formally approve the scope documents (like a specification) as the definitive version against which all future progress, performance, and changes will be measured.

- **Q:** In a programme, what is the document that is equivalent to a project's specification?
    - **A:** The blueprint.
