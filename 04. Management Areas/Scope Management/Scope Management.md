# Scope Management

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Scope Management

## General Principles of Scope Management

- **Definition**: Scope management is the function that identifies, defines, and controls the objectives of the work, in the form of outputs, outcomes, and benefits.

- **Scope**: The totality of outputs, outcomes, and benefits that should be delivered by a project, programme, or portfolio.

### The Goals of Scope Management

- The primary goals of this function are to:
    
    1. Identify stakeholder wants and needs.
    
    2. Specify the outputs, outcomes, and benefits that will meet the agreed requirements.
    
    3. Maintain and control the scope throughout the life cycle.

> [IMPORTANT]  
> The complexity of the scope is the main distinguishing factor between work that is managed as a project, a programme, or a portfolio. A key element in this decision is whether achieving the objectives requires significant changes to business-as-usual. Extensive and complex change is a strong indicator that programme governance is more appropriate.

## The Five Areas of Scope Management

- Scope management is made up of five main areas that work together to identify, define, and control what the work will deliver.

1. **Requirements Management**:
    
    - Captures and analyses stakeholder views of the work’s objectives.
    
    - Requirements are **"solution-free"**—they describe the stakeholders’ wants and needs (the "what" and "why") but do not determine the specific outputs required to meet them (the "how").

2. **Solutions Development**:
    
    - Takes the agreed requirements and investigates _how_ they may be met.
    
    - It designs the tangible outputs and technical solutions that will provide the best return on investment.

3. **Benefits Management**:
    
    - Takes requirements that have been expressed in terms of benefits and manages them through their entire life cycle to their eventual delivery and measurement.
    
    - Benefits management is usually dependent on change management to convert the project's outputs into business outcomes, from which benefits can be derived.

4. **Change Control**:
    
    - This is a formal procedure that captures and assesses potential **changes to the baselined scope**.
    
    - It ensures that only desirable, achievable, and viable changes are approved and implemented.

5. **Configuration Management**:
    
    - Monitors and documents the development and status of the products (or configuration items).
    
    - It records the versions of products, tracks the status of approved changes, and archives superseded versions. The information in a configuration management system is a key input to assessing change requests.

> [NOTE]  
> The evolution of P3 terminology has created potential confusion. It's vital to distinguish between:
> 
> - **Change Control**: The process for managing changes to the project's _scope_.
> 
> - **Change Management**: The work involved in changing working practices in _business-as-usual_ to realise benefits.

## Managing Scope: Linear vs. Flexible Approaches

- The degree to which the requirements and solution can be predicted at the beginning of the work will influence how scope is managed.

- **Linear/Predictive Approach**:
    
    - Used where the objective is well understood and has a tangible output (e.g., in construction and engineering).
    
    - The goal is to define the scope as accurately and completely as possible in the **definition phase**.
    
    - A formal **change control** process is then used to manage all potential changes to this baseline, with a focus on reducing cost escalation and maintaining the viability of the business case.
    
    - It is also useful to explicitly define what is **out of scope** to avoid misunderstandings and manage stakeholder expectations.

- **Flexible/Adaptive Approach**:
    
    - Needed where the objective is less tangible or subject to significant change (e.g., business change or some IT systems).
    
    - A **parallel life cycle** (agile) is often adopted, where the scope is iteratively refined throughout the delivery phase.
    
    - This requires a different approach to control to avoid uncontrolled cost escalation.

### Value Management

- An important factor that runs through all areas of scope management is **value management**. This is a discipline that brings together a set of procedures and techniques to ensure that the investment in a project, programme, or portfolio is optimised for the potential return it can deliver.

## Scope Management in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Projects

- **Breakdown Structures**: Once an output has been specified, the work needed to create it can be broken down. This is presented as a **Product Breakdown Structure (PBS)** and/or a **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**.

- **Baselines**: In traditional projects, the approved breakdown structure is baselined at the end of the definition process. The products in the PBS become **configuration items** in a configuration management system, and any proposed changes must go through the formal change control procedure.

- **Agile Projects**: The scope baseline will initially comprise functional requirements rather than fully specified products. The products that fulfil these functions are then developed in iterations (e.g., timeboxes or sprints).

### Programmes

- **Scope Specification**: Programme requirements are typically described in terms of outcomes and benefits. The scope of a programme is therefore specified using a **blueprint** (the future state), **benefit profiles**, and a list of the **component projects** needed to deliver the required outputs.

- **Interdependencies**: The relationship between outputs, outcomes, and benefits is rarely one-to-one. The programme management team must define, document, and manage these complex interdependencies.

- **Evolving Scope**: The scope of a programme tends to be more fluid than that of a project. It is unlikely that all solutions can be identified at the outset, and the business environment may change. The programme management team must be adept at managing this evolving scope throughout the life cycle.

### Portfolios

- **Standard Portfolio**:
    
    - This is an accumulation of projects and programmes with unconnected objectives.
    
    - Its scope is flexible and is simply the **sum of the projects and programmes** it contains at any given time.

- **Structured Portfolio**:
    
    - This is defined by the strategic objectives of its host organisation.
    
    - Its scope is the **sum of the projects, programmes, and change activity required to deliver those strategic objectives**.

- **Scope Management Process**:
    
    - Scope management of a structured portfolio starts by identifying relevant projects and programmes to meet strategic goals.
    
    - The scope is then regularly reviewed and adjusted through the **prioritisation and balancing** activities in the portfolio management process.
    
    - Eligibility criteria (e.g., required ROI, acceptable risk) are established to govern which new initiatives are added to the portfolio.
    
    - The portfolio management team helps project and programme sponsors shape their proposals to ensure they align with the portfolio's scope and strategic objectives.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the five main areas of scope management?
    - **A:** Requirements management, Solutions development, Benefits management, Change control, and Configuration management.

- **Q:** What does it mean for requirements to be "solution-free"?
    - **A:** They describe the stakeholders’ wants and needs without pre-determining the specific output or technical solution required to meet them.

- **Q:** What is the key difference between change control and change management?
    - **A:** **Change control** manages changes to the project's baselined scope. **Change management** is the work of changing business-as-usual practices to realise benefits.

- **Q:** What are the primary documents used to specify the scope of a programme?
    - **A:** A blueprint, benefit profiles, and a list of component projects.

- **Q:** How is the scope of a structured portfolio defined and managed?
    - **A:** It is defined by the strategic objectives of the host organisation. It is managed by regularly reviewing, prioritising, and balancing the component projects and programmes to ensure they remain aligned with those objectives.
