# Scope Management

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Scope Management Capability Maturity

## Overall Goal of Scope Management

- The function of Scope Management should:
    
    - Identify stakeholder wants and needs.
    
    - Specify the outputs, outcomes, and benefits that meet agreed requirements.
    
    - Maintain and control the scope throughout the life cycle.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The capability maturity model for Scope Management presented here is a high-level summary. It combines the capabilities for the multiple functions that make up overall scope management (requirements, solution, change, benefits).  
> <br><br>  
> This summary is best suited for an organisation that runs less complex projects which include benefits management. In more complex situations (e.g., large business change programmes) or more specific contexts (e.g., a contracting organisation that doesn't manage benefits), it is better to use the relevant capability models for the individual scope management functions to get a more accurate assessment.

## Level 2 Capability Attributes

- At this level, the scope management functions are **performed and managed**. The goals are generally achieved, but the processes may be inconsistent across different projects. Success often depends on the competence of the individual project manager.

- **Manage Requirements**
    - Requirements are captured from **key stakeholders**.

- **Develop Solution**
    - A solution is developed based on the documented requirements.

- **Implement Solution**
    
    - Change requests are logged and assessed.
    
    - The results of the assessment (approved/rejected) are communicated back to the requesting stakeholder.
    
    - Basic version control of products is maintained.

- **Manage Benefits**
    
    - Benefits are identified and documented.
    
    - The implementation of the benefits is planned at a high level.

## Level 3 Capability Attributes

- At this level, the scope management functions are performed according to a **defined, standard process** that is tailored to the context of the work. The process is consistent, efficient, and embedded in the organisational culture.

- **Manage Requirements**
    
    - A **variety of techniques** (e.g., workshops, interviews, surveys) are used to capture requirements from **all relevant stakeholders**.
    
    - The captured requirements are **fully analysed** for conflicts, overlaps, and gaps, and are then formally **baselined**.

- **Develop Solution**
    
    - There is clear evidence that a **range of potential solutions** has been considered and evaluated before selecting the optimum one.
    
    - The resulting **specification is thorough** and detailed.

- **Implement Solution**
    
    - Change requests are not just logged; **all aspects of their impact** on the work (e.g., on cost, schedule, risk, and benefits) are **thoroughly assessed**.
    
    - The responsibility for approving changes is **clearly defined** (e.g., a Change Control Board).
    
    - Budgets for implementing approved changes are formally allocated.
    
    - Where appropriate, the development of products is formally recorded within a **configuration management system**, not just simple version control.

- **Manage Benefits**
    
    - **Standard format profiles** exist for documenting both benefits and dis-benefits, ensuring consistency.
    
    - **Quantitative metrics** are used to confirm the achievement of benefits, allowing for objective measurement against the business case.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** At Level 2, from whom are requirements typically captured?
    - **A:** From **key stakeholders**.

- **Q:** How does requirements capture change at Level 3?
    - **A:** A variety of techniques are used to capture requirements from **all stakeholders**, which are then fully analysed and formally baselined.

- **Q:** What is the key difference in how change requests are handled between Level 2 and Level 3?
    - **A:** At Level 2, they are logged and assessed. At Level 3, **all aspects of their impact** are **thoroughly assessed**, and there is a clearly defined approval authority and budget.

- **Q:** How does the documentation of benefits differ between Level 2 and Level 3?
    - **A:** At Level 2, benefits are simply identified and documented. At Level 3, **standard format profiles** are used for both benefits and dis-benefits, and **quantitative metrics** are used to confirm their achievement.

- **Q:** What is the key difference in the "Develop Solution" attribute between Level 2 and Level 3?
    - **A:** At Level 2, a solution is developed. At Level 3, there is clear evidence that a **range of solutions** was considered before the optimum one was selected and specified.
