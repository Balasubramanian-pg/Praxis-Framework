# Delivery Process

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Delivery Process Maturity

## Overall Goals of the Delivery Process

- The goals of this process are to:
    
    - Delegate responsibility for producing deliverables to the appropriate people.
    
    - Monitor the performance of the work and track it against the delivery plans.
    
    - Take action where necessary to keep the work in line with plans.
    
    - Escalate issues and replan if necessary.
    
    - Formally accept work as it is completed.
    
    - Maintain effective communication with all stakeholders.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> How the delivery process is implemented, and therefore how its maturity is assessed, depends heavily on the complexity of the work.  
> <br><br>
> 
> - Less complex projects will have few work packages, while programmes will have many.
> 
> - More complex work will require more sophisticated control techniques (e.g., Earned Value Management) than simpler work (e.g., Gantt-based slip charts).
> 
> - Where the work includes delegated work packages using the **development process**, the maturity of the two processes should be the same. The delivery process cannot be at Level 3 if the development process is only at Level 2.

## Level 2 Maturity Attributes

- At this level, the delivery process is **managed**. Work is formally authorised and tracked, but the co-ordination and control may be less integrated and more reactive than at Level 3.

- **Description**
    
    - The delivery phase is managed separately from the definition phase.
    
    - Where appropriate, the phase is divided into stages or tranches.

- **Authorise work**
    - Work is divided into packages that are formally assigned to teams with defined performance criteria.

- **Co-ordinate and monitor progress**
    
    - Progress is recorded, and its impact is assessed and acted upon.
    
    - Teams working on different work packages are co-ordinated.

- **Update and communicate**
    - Documentation is regularly updated and disseminated in accordance with the communications plan.

- **Corrective action**
    
    - **Exception plans** are produced when necessary (i.e., after a major issue has occurred).
    
    - Work is terminated when a business case is no longer achievable.

- **Accept completed work**
    - Deliverables are formally accepted by the management team.

## Level 3 Maturity Attributes

- At this level, the delivery process is based on a **defined, standard process** that is tailored to the context. Management is proactive, and information is consistent and consolidated across all parts of the work.

- **Description**
    
    - A process for the delivery phase is **centrally defined**.
    
    - This standard process is then **tailored** to suit the specific context of the work.

- **Authorise work**
    - The **impact of new work packages** on the performance of existing work packages is proactively assessed before authorisation.

- **Co-ordinate and monitor progress**
    
    - Progress information from multiple work packages is **consistent and consolidated** into a single, coherent picture of overall progress.
    
    - Plans are regularly reviewed, and updated information is formally **fed back** to the work packages.

- **Update and communicate**
    
    - Adherence to the communications plan is actively **monitored and controlled**.
    
    - Key documents are subject to formal **configuration management**.

- **Corrective action**
    - Systems and forecasting techniques are in place to **identify the need for corrective action in advance** of issues occurring.

- **Accept completed work**
    - Deliverables are subject to a **consistent acceptance procedure**, including formal **sign-off and handover**.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is the key difference in the overall description of the delivery process between Level 2 and Level 3?
    - **A:** At Level 2, the phase is managed separately. At Level 3, the process is based on a **centrally defined standard** that is **tailored** to the context.

- **Q:** How does the authorisation of work differ between Level 2 and Level 3?
    - **A:** At Level 2, work packages are formally assigned. At Level 3, the **impact of new work packages on existing ones** is assessed _before_ they are authorised.

- **Q:** What is the main difference in how progress is monitored between Level 2 and Level 3?
    - **A:** At Level 2, progress is recorded and assessed. At Level 3, progress information from multiple sources is required to be **consistent and is formally consolidated**.

- **Q:** How does corrective action demonstrate a more mature approach at Level 3?
    - **A:** At Level 2, exception plans are produced reactively. At Level 3, systems are in place to **identify the need for corrective action in advance**, allowing for proactive management.

- **Q:** What distinguishes the acceptance of work at Level 3 from Level 2?
    - **A:** At Level 2, deliverables are formally accepted. At Level 3, they are subject to a **consistent, formal acceptance procedure** that includes defined sign-off and handover protocols.
