# Comprehensive Study Notes: Conflict Management

## General Principles of Conflict Management

- **Definition**: Conflict is typically perceived as something negative that has a detrimental impact on achieving objectives. However, some aspects of conflict can be used positively.

- It is crucial to recognise the difference between **conflict management** (the broader proactive and reactive approach) and **conflict resolution** (the reactive step of solving a specific dispute).

### The Goals of Conflict Management

- The primary goals of conflict management in a P3 context are to:
    
    - Utilise the **positive aspects** of conflict (e.g., to foster innovation and build high-performing teams).
    
    - Resolve organisational and interpersonal conflict when it becomes negative and counter-productive.
    
    - Minimise the overall **impact of negative conflict** on the project, programme, or portfolio objectives.

### Conflict in the P3 Environment

- The P3 environment is a situation that is almost designed to create conflict. People from different backgrounds and departments come together on a **temporary basis** to work in **new and changing situations** to produce a unique set of objectives.

- Research by Thamhain and Wilemon identified seven main sources of conflict in projects, including **schedules, priorities, and costs**. They also noted that the intensity of conflict created by these sources varies throughout the project life cycle.

### The Human Element of Conflict

- While issues like schedules and costs may be contentious, **it takes people to cause a conflict**. Disagreements can involve any parties to the work, such as two team members, a manager and a supplier, or two key stakeholders.

- Disagreements generally arise from human factors such as:
    
    - Conflicting working styles.
    
    - Unspoken assumptions and miscommunication.
    
    - Conflicting perceptions or roles.
    
    - Differing personal values.
    
    - Emotions such as stress, fear, and uncertainty.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Given the high potential for conflict to adversely affect objectives, a skilled P3 manager must focus on conflict management to pre-empt and avoid negative conflict before it occurs, not just on conflict resolution after it has erupted.

## Positive vs. Negative Conflict

- The P3 manager should anticipate conflict but not necessarily seek to avoid all of it.

- **Positive Conflict**: Some degree of conflict is seen as a necessary part of building a high-performing team.
    
    - **Example**: The "storming" stage of team development in Tuckman’s model, where different ideas and perspectives clash, is a form of healthy conflict.
    
    - Facilitating healthy, respectful disagreement can help develop individuals, provide valuable learning experiences, and lead to more innovative solutions.
    
    - This must be carefully managed by the P3 manager to prevent it from becoming negative and counter-productive.

- **Negative Conflict**: When conflict does become negative, it needs to be resolved quickly to minimise the damage.
    
    - Unresolved negative conflict creates uncertainty, damages morale, and undermines the effectiveness of a team.
    
    - Ultimately, this can result in delays or even the complete failure to deliver the objectives.

## Identifying and Resolving Negative Conflict

### Indicators of Conflict

- Conflicts can emerge suddenly or build gradually. The intensity of a conflict is usually described by the magnitude and frequency of the events.

- **Obvious Indicators**: Hostility, lack of co-operation, an obvious direct challenge to authority or decisions.

- **Hidden Indicators**: Changes in an individual's style or communication, opting out of team activities, passive obstruction, or subversive behaviour.

### The Resolution Process

- When attempting to resolve a conflict, it is useful to distinguish its different components. As Gary Furlong points out, a resolution is easier to find if the focus is on objective factors like **data and structure** rather than on subjective and emotional factors like **values and relationships**.

- **Mediation**: For some forms of conflict, a mediator can be useful.
    
    - This could be a matter of **authority** (e.g., a sponsor mediating between a manager and a senior stakeholder).
    
    - It could be a matter of **expert knowledge** (e.g., an HR professional mediating an employment issue).
    
    - A good mediator must focus on the issues, not the personalities, listen actively, and facilitate negotiation towards a resolution.

- **Typical Actions for Interpersonal Conflict Resolution**:
    
    - Careful choice of a neutral, comfortable, and accessible **venue**.
    
    - Clear **time management** and ground rules for acceptable conduct.
    
    - **Identification of facts** and a clear separation from assumptions.
    
    - Recognising the different levels of **power and influence** among the participants.
    
    - Assessing the potential impact of personal **values and opinions**.
    
    - Reflecting perspectives, expectations, and antagonisms, while **emphasising areas of agreement**.
    
    - Having a defined **escalation route** if a resolution is not possible at that level.

### Conflict Resolution Styles

- Conflict resolution is a complex skill. Understanding specific techniques and models can help individuals develop their competence.

- A particularly useful model for a P3 manager is the **Thomas-Kilmann Instrument (TKI)**, which is based on Blake and Mouton’s managerial grid.

- The TKI is designed to identify an individual’s natural, preferred style for responding to conflict (e.g., competing, collaborating, compromising, avoiding, accommodating).

- Different styles are needed in different circumstances. Perhaps the hardest skill in conflict resolution is consciously adopting a style that is personally unnatural but is the right one for the specific situation.

## Conflict in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

- The overall intensity of conflict will inevitably increase as the **complexity of the work increases**.

- As projects grow in size and complexity, the number and diversity of people involved increases, as do the number of products, targets, and interdependencies.

- Some projects and all programmes will include **change management**, which is a natural source of conflict as people are asked to change their ways of working.

> [!NOTE]  
> As work scales up from projects to programmes and from programmes to portfolios, the effort and investment spent on proactive conflict management must also grow. This investment will primarily be seen in areas such as:
> 
> - Stakeholder Management
> 
> - Teamwork and Team Building
> 
> - Risk Management
> 
> - The early stages of the life cycle (Identification and Definition), where most conflicts originate.

- In programmes and portfolios, the management team must **co-ordinate conflict resolution** across all the component parts.
    
    - For example, a single stakeholder might be in dispute with two different projects within the same programme, and these disputes might be being resolved differently.
    
    - A programme or portfolio management team needs to maintain an overview of all significant conflicts being addressed to ensure consistency and prevent escalation.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is the difference between conflict management and conflict resolution?
    - **A:** **Conflict resolution** is the reactive process of solving a specific dispute. **Conflict management** is the broader approach that includes proactively avoiding negative conflict and utilising the positive aspects of conflict, as well as resolution.

- **Q:** What is an example of "positive conflict"?
    - **A:** The "storming" stage of team development, where healthy and respectful disagreement can lead to better ideas and a stronger team.

- **Q:** What did Thamhain and Wilemon identify as major sources of conflict in projects?
    - **A:** Seven main sources, including schedules, priorities, and costs.

- **Q:** According to Gary Furlong, what components of a conflict should a mediator focus on to find a resolution more easily?
    - **A:** Objective factors such as data and structure, rather than subjective factors like values and relationships.

- **Q:** What is the Thomas-Kilmann Instrument (TKI) used for?
    - **A:** It is a model used to identify an individual’s natural, preferred style for responding to conflict.

- **Q:** How does conflict management change as work scales up from projects to programmes and portfolios?
    - **A:** The effort and investment in proactive conflict management (e.g., stakeholder management, risk management) must increase. The management team must also take on the role of co-ordinating conflict resolution across all the component parts.
