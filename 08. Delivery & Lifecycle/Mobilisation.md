# Comprehensive Study Notes: Mobilisation

## General Principles of Mobilisation

- **Definition**: Mobilisation is the function that ensures the appropriate organisational and technical infrastructures are put in place for acquiring and deploying resources. It also ensures that these infrastructures are dismantled or the resources are redeployed when they are no longer required.

### The Goals of Mobilisation

- The primary goals of this function are to ensure that:
    
    1. Capital assets are operational and accessible.
    
    2. Facilities are operational and accessible.
    
    3. Delivery team members are competent and capable.
    
    4. All resources are redeployed, returned, or disposed of at the end of the work.

### Mobilisation in the Life Cycle

- Mobilisation occurs at various points in the life cycle, not just at the very beginning.

- **Identification and Definition Processes**: Some mobilisation is required to put in place the teams and facilities needed to complete this early-phase work.

- **Start of Delivery**: The mobilisation of the full project or programme infrastructure occurs once the main authorisation has been given. (Some limited mobilisation may take place earlier as "pre-authorisation work" to shorten the overall schedule).

- **During Delivery**: Mobilisation also occurs to a lesser extent as each new **tranche or stage** is started and finished.

## The Mobilisation Procedure

1. **Plan Mobilisation**:
    - This step defines what infrastructure is needed and how it will be put in place.

2. **Acquire Infrastructure**:
    - This involves securing the necessary premises, IT hardware/software, plant, and machinery.

3. **Acquire Resources**:
    - This involves acquiring the internal and external human resources needed to perform the work.

4. **Develop Team**:
    - This step focuses on taking the acquired individuals and developing them into a cohesive and effective team.

5. **Demobilise**:
    - At the end of the work, this step involves the planned dismantling of the infrastructure, disposal of assets, and redeployment of staff.

### Elements Covered by Mobilisation

- The mobilisation procedure can cover any of the following:
    
    - The management team.
    
    - Premises and office facilities.
    
    - IT hardware, software tools, and telecoms.
    
    - Plant and machinery.
    
    - Internal and external resources (people).
    
    - Governance procedures and systems.

### Key Mobilisation Challenges

- **Co-location vs. Virtual Teams**: Management teams should be co-located whenever possible to improve communication and teamwork. When co-location isn’t possible (e.g., in multi-company partnerships or international projects), the IT infrastructure that facilitates effective virtual teams becomes critical.

- **Acquiring Internal Resources**: In a **matrix organisation**, resources often retain their departmental home while also having a role in the project. The P3 manager’s resource plans may conflict with business-as-usual demands. Good conflict management and influencing skills are essential to negotiate for these resources.

## Demobilisation

- The temporary nature of projects and programmes means that mobilisation will always be followed by **demobilisation** once the work is complete. This has a significant impact on many aspects of the work.

- **Capital Assets**: When capital investment in plant and machinery is needed, decisions must be made whether to buy (with resale in mind), lease, or rent, based on the planned demobilisation.

- **Team Dynamics**: When building P3 teams, managers must always bear in mind that the approaching demobilisation affects traditional team development cycles (like Tuckman's model). The final "adjourning" or "mourning" stage is a key part of the P3 team experience.

- **Planning for Demobilisation**: As the need to demobilise approaches, formal plans must be drawn up to dispose of assets, redeploy staff, and, if necessary, reinstate premises to their previous condition.

## Mobilisation in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Small Projects

- On some small projects, very little formal mobilisation may be needed. Facilities are already in place, and resources do not need to physically move.

- In this context, the work is more about **teamwork** than physical mobilisation.

- However, even the smallest projects must consider the eventual **demobilisation** of the team, as P3 teams are transient by nature, unlike permanent business-as-usual teams.

### Programmes and Large Complex Projects

- When mobilising these larger initiatives, the management team must consider the needs of all the component work packages or projects.

- While the central programme management team and its infrastructure will be in place for the duration of the work, there will be multiple components that need to be mobilised and demobilised throughout the life cycle.

- The management team must consider the impact of the overall schedule on the infrastructure requirements. For example, the ability to **share the costs of mobilisation** (e.g., setting up a site office) across multiple projects must be weighed against the impact on benefits and the business case.

### Portfolios

- A portfolio organisation is more **permanent** than a project or programme.

- Portfolio mobilisation is typically a **one-off project** that sets up the permanent infrastructure required to co-ordinate projects and programmes through multiple planning cycles.

- A dedicated portfolio infrastructure forms the basis for an organisation to improve its **capability maturity**. It may include permanent organisational structures, such as a **Project Management Office (PMO)**, to provide support and governance.

- The mobilisation of a portfolio requires strong support and commitment at the **host organisation’s board level** to ensure that it is thorough and resilient. Only then will the portfolio infrastructure become properly embedded in the organisation as the preferred way of delivering projects and programmes.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the four primary goals of mobilisation?
    - **A:** To ensure capital assets are operational, facilities are accessible, team members are competent, and all resources are properly disposed of or redeployed at the end of the work.

- **Q:** What is the key difference between mobilisation and demobilisation?
    - **A:** **Mobilisation** is about putting the necessary infrastructure and resources in place to start the work. **Demobilisation** is the reverse process of dismantling the infrastructure and redeploying resources when the work is complete.

- **Q:** What is a major challenge when acquiring internal resources in a matrix organisation?
    - **A:** The P3 manager's resource plans may conflict with the business-as-usual demands of the departmental managers, requiring good negotiation and influencing skills.

- **Q:** How does mobilisation differ for a programme compared to a small project?
    - **A:** A programme involves the mobilisation and demobilisation of multiple component projects throughout its life cycle and must consider how to share infrastructure costs across them. A small project's mobilisation is much simpler.

- **Q:** How is the mobilisation of a portfolio different from that of a project or programme?
    - **A:** Portfolio mobilisation is typically a one-off project to set up a permanent infrastructure (like a PMO) to manage and co-ordinate projects and programmes on an ongoing basis. It is a strategic, long-term activity.
