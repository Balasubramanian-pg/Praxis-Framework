# Comprehensive Study Notes: Solutions Development

## General Principles of Solutions Development

- **Definition**: Solutions development is the function that determines the best way of satisfying the baselined requirements for an output.

### The Goals of Solutions Development

- The primary goals of this function are to:
    
    1. Evaluate the baseline requirements and consider alternative solutions to achieve them.
    
    2. Select the **optimum solution**.
    
    3. Create a detailed **specification** for the selected solution.

- **Relationship with Other Functions**:
    
    - **Requirements management** produces a clear set of stakeholder requirements (the "what") but does not explain _how_ to meet them.
    
    - **Solutions development** investigates the technical options for meeting those requirements (the "how").
    
    - This function works in close conjunction with **investment appraisal** (part of financial management), which investigates the financial implications of the different technical options.

## The Solutions Development Procedure

1. **Plan and Initiate**:
    
    - Since the solutions development steps follow on naturally from those in the requirements management procedure, it would be unusual for it to have separate, dedicated planning and initiation steps. It is typically covered under the overarching scope management plan.
    
    - However, in some contractual circumstances where requirements management and solutions development are the responsibility of different organisations (e.g., a client and a contractor), the procedures may be separate.

2. **Evaluate Options**:
    
    - This step looks at alternative approaches and assesses how well they will perform against a set of stated criteria.
    
    - These criteria could include capital cost, speed of delivery, degree of risk, ongoing operational costs, and alignment with strategic goals.
    
    - The techniques involved can range from simple **"make or buy"** considerations to the full-blown modelling and simulation of highly innovative solutions. A **value management** approach can be used to help select the options that provide the best value for money.

3. **Select Solution**:
    - Based on the evaluation, one solution emerges and is selected as the optimum approach.

4. **Develop Specification**:
    
    - The selected solution is then developed into a detailed **specification**.
    
    - In some cases, especially in large or agile projects, the detailed elements of the specification may only cover the early stages of development, with the specification for later stages being refined as the work proceeds.

5. **Validate and Verify**:
    - The solution should be regularly checked against the requirements (which may themselves be subject to change). This checking takes two forms:
        
        - **Verification**: This is the term used to ensure that the solution is being **built right**. It is a check against the _specification_. This is part of quality control and configuration management.
        
        - **Validation**: This is the term used to ensure that the **right product is being built**. It is a check against the original _requirements_ and the business case to ensure the solution still meets the stakeholders' needs.

## Solutions Development in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Projects

- The great majority of projects are designed to deliver a specific output.

- **Simple Projects**: Where the requirements are simple and use tried-and-tested technology, the type of solution may be implicitly understood by the stakeholders (e.g., the requirement to keep a car dry is implicitly solved by building a garage). In this case, solutions development becomes the simple production of a specification without a preceding, detailed consideration of radical alternatives.

- **Traditional Projects**: These describe the output in a formal **specification**. This document is contained within the definition documentation and is submitted for approval at the end of the definition process. The specification may be supported by additional information such as a Product Breakdown Structure (PBS) or Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).

- **Agile Projects**: Agile methods place much less emphasis on the detailed specification of a solution early in the life cycle. Instead, they focus on a prioritised list of functions that are delivered incrementally in a series of **timeboxes or sprints**. The detail of the output evolves during these iterations. This approach is designed to address the typical problem where it is difficult for a stakeholder to fully accept or understand components of a system until they can actually see it in action.

### Programmes

- The equivalent of the specification for a programme of business change is the **blueprint**.

- The blueprint describes the cumulative effect of the change on the organisation. It is a detailed picture of the future state, showing all the outcomes that will be created by the programme.  
    *-**Co-ordination Role**: Each project within the programme is aimed at delivering an output that contributes to the blueprint. The programme management team must **co-ordinate the solutions** proposed by the different projects and review their proposals.

- This co-ordination is necessary to ensure the compatibility of solutions proposed by different projects and to identify common components or technology platforms that can be shared between projects to improve efficiency and consistency.

### Portfolios

- Solutions development is predominantly a project and programme matter.

- However, the **portfolio management team** may set high-level guidelines or policies regarding innovation and risk appetite that will **constrain the types of solutions** that can be considered by the component projects and programmes. For example, a portfolio might mandate the use of a specific technology platform or forbid the use of high-risk, unproven technologies.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the three main goals of solutions development?
    - **A:** 1. Evaluate alternative solutions, 2. Select the optimum solution, and 3. Create a specification for that solution.

- **Q:** What is the difference between verification and validation?
    - **A:** **Verification** is checking that the product is being "built right" (against the specification). **Validation** is checking that the "right product is being built" (against the original requirements and business case).

- **Q:** In an agile project, how is the solution developed?
    - **A:** It is not specified in detail upfront. Instead, it evolves incrementally through the delivery of prioritised functions in a series of timeboxes or sprints.

- **Q:** What is the "blueprint" in a programme?
    - **A:** It is the equivalent of a specification for a programme. It is a detailed description of the future state of the organisation, showing the cumulative effect of all the changes and outcomes the programme will deliver.

- **Q:** What is the main role of a programme management team in solutions development?
    - **A:** To co-ordinate and review the solutions proposed by its component projects to ensure they are compatible, efficient, and collectively contribute to the programme's blueprint.
