# Comprehensive Study Notes: Delivery Functions

## Introduction to Delivery Functions

- **Definition**: The "Delivery" area of P3 management is about the core functions that are immediately and directly concerned with the delivery of outputs, outcomes, and benefits.

- It comprises six fundamental components that are essential to every project, programme, and portfolio, plus a seventh area for functions that integrate the others.

### The Six Fundamental Components of Delivery

1. **Scope**: What are the objectives and what is the scope of the work?

2. **Schedule**: How long will it take to achieve the objectives?

3. **Finance**: How are the necessary funds acquired and how are the costs managed?

4. **Risk**: What are the threats to success and the opportunities that can be leveraged?

5. **Change**: What areas of business-as-usual must be changed in order to realise benefits from the project's outputs?

6. **Resource**: How will the necessary resources (people, equipment, materials) be acquired, mobilised, and managed?

### Integrative Management

- Some functions operate across and integrate these six fundamental components. These are collected together under the general title of **integrative management**.

## The Generic Delivery Procedure

- Most of the functions within the Delivery section contain a **procedure** that describes the typical steps that should be followed to manage that function.

- These procedures are often iterative and follow a generic pattern.

### The Generic Procedural Steps

1. **Plan**:
    
    - This step involves creating a **management plan** for that specific function (e.g., a Risk Management Plan, a Scope Management Plan).
    
    - This plan describes the policies, procedures, tools, and techniques that should be used to manage that function throughout the life cycle.

2. **Initiate**:
    
    - This step covers the mobilisation of the resources required to perform the procedure.
    
    - It's about getting everything in place to be able to execute the plan.

3. **Specific Steps (e.g., Identify, Assess, Respond)**:
    
    - These are the steps that relate to the work that is unique to each function.
    
    - For example, in Risk Management, these steps are "Identify Risks," "Assess Risks," and "Plan Risk Responses." In Finance Management, they are "Estimate Costs" and "Determine Budget."

4. **Review and Report**:
    
    - This is the ongoing monitoring and control step.
    
    - It involves reviewing the performance of the function, gathering data, and reporting progress and issues to the relevant stakeholders.

## Applying the Procedures in the Life Cycle

- The functional procedures are not performed just once. They will be **repeatedly performed in each of the life cycle phases**, but they must be adapted to the circumstances and context of that phase.

- Depending on the life cycle phase, the focus will be on different procedural steps.

- **Example: Risk Management**
    
    - **Identification Phase**: The "Identify" and "Assess" steps will be performed at a high level to understand the major risks and inform the outline business case. The "Plan" step will be very brief.
    
    - **Definition Phase**: The "Plan" step is performed in detail to create the full Risk Management Plan. The "Identify," "Assess," and "Plan Responses" steps are performed in much greater detail to inform the detailed business case and delivery plans.
    
    - **Delivery Phase**: The "Plan Responses" (now "Implement Responses") and "Review and Report" steps are the primary focus, with the identification and assessment steps being repeated to find new and emerging risks.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The ability to perform these procedures in a way that is appropriate to the different life cycle phases is a common element of competence and a key attribute of level 3 capability maturity.

### Collective Planning and Initiation

> [!NOTE]  
> Although the "Plan" and "Initiate" steps are shown separately for each individual function, in practice they will largely be performed collectively for all functions.

- **Planning Step**: The planning for all six delivery functions is normally done as part of preparing the main governance documents (like the Project or Programme Management Plan) during the **definition process**.

- **Initiation Step**: The initiation and mobilisation of resources will be divided between the latter part of the **definition process** (getting ready for delivery) and the beginning of the **delivery process** (starting the main work).

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the six fundamental delivery functions in P3 management?
    - **A:** Scope, Schedule, Finance, Risk, Change, and Resource management.

- **Q:** What is the purpose of the "Plan" step in a generic delivery procedure?
    - **A:** To create a management plan for that function which describes the policies, procedures, tools, and techniques to be used.

- **Q:** When in the life cycle are the management plans for the delivery functions typically created?
    - **A:** During the **definition process**, as part of preparing the main governance documents.

- **Q:** Are the delivery function procedures performed only once?
    - **A:** No, they are repeatedly performed in each phase of the life cycle, but they are adapted to the context of that phase.

- **Q:** The ability to tailor the application of functional procedures to different life cycle phases is a key attribute of which level of capability maturity?
    - **A:** Level 3.
