# Interpersonnel Competencies

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Interpersonal Competencies

## General Principles of Interpersonal Competencies

- **Definition**: Interpersonal competencies are one of three groups of competencies in the Praxis Framework, alongside **delivery** and **process** competencies.

- **Alignment**: They align directly with the **interpersonal functions** described in the Knowledge section of the Praxis Framework.

- **Nature**: These competencies are not unique to project, programme, and portfolio management. They are the universal "soft skills" of leadership, communication, and teamwork, but they are defined and applied here specifically within the P3 context. They are often expressed in terms of personal behaviours and personality characteristics.

## The Relationship Between Functions and Competencies

- As with the delivery competencies, there is a direct one-to-one relationship between the interpersonal functions and the interpersonal competencies.

- The **function** (from the Knowledge section) describes _what_ the area of management is and the principles and models involved (the theory).

- The **competency** (from the Competence section) describes the ability to _apply and implement_ that function successfully in practice.

### Naming Convention: Function vs. Competency

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The titles of the competencies reflect the fact that competency is about the active implementation of the functions, rather than simply describing what the functions are.

- This is illustrated by a simple change in the naming convention from a noun (the function) to a verb (the competency).
    
    - The function is called **Conflict Management**.
    
    - The corresponding competency is called **Manage Conflict**.
    
    - The function is called **Leadership**.
    
    - The corresponding competency is called **Lead**.
    
    - The function is called **Communication**.
    
    - The corresponding competency is called **Communicate**.

- This shift emphasizes that a competency is not about knowing the theory of conflict management; it is about being able to _actually manage conflict_ effectively in a real-world P3 environment.

## Tailoring Interpersonal Competencies

- The interpersonal competencies described in the Praxis section focus on _how_ these universal functions need to be implemented specifically within the P3 context.

- The framework is designed to be adaptable. Organisations can add additional, more specific behavioural indicators to these competencies as part of tailoring Praxis to their own culture and needs.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the three groups of competencies in the Praxis Framework?
    - **A:** Delivery, Interpersonal, and Process competencies.

- **Q:** How do interpersonal competencies relate to interpersonal functions?
    - **A:** The competencies represent the practical application and implementation of the theoretical functions.

- *Q: **How does the naming convention for interpersonal competencies reflect their purpose?
    - **A:** They use a verb (e.g., "Manage Conflict") instead of a noun (e.g., "Conflict Management") to emphasize that competency is about active implementation.

- **Q:** Are interpersonal skills like leadership and communication unique to P3 management?
    - **A:** No, they are universal skills. The Praxis competencies focus on how these skills are specifically applied within the unique context of projects, programmes, and portfolios.
