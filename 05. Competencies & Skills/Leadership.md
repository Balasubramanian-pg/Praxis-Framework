# Comprehensive Study Notes: Leadership

## General Principles of Leadership

- **Origin**: The word "lead" derives from an ancient term meaning a path, road, or journey. By implication, a **leader** is one who guides those travelling the path.

- **Definition**: Leadership has many definitions. In the context of P3 management, it is best defined by its goals.

### The Goals of Leadership

- The primary goals of a leader in a P-3 context are to:
    
    1. Provide **focus** and promote **commitment** to the objectives of the work.
    
    2. **Inspire** team members to successfully achieve those objectives.

### Transactional vs. Transformational Leadership

- Leadership theory often revolves around the relationship between the leader and their followers. The evolution from McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y managers leads to the concepts of transactional and transformational leaders.

- **Transactional Leadership**:
    
    - This is an **exchange process**. The leader ensures that requirements are agreed upon and that the rewards and penalties for achievement (or lack thereof) are clearly understood.
    
    - It is about setting objectives, communicating plans, and explaining what team members will receive in return for their effort.
    
    - This approach primarily addresses the first goal of leadership (providing focus and commitment) and is reflected in P3 functions like requirements management, contract management, and the definition process.

- **Transformational Leadership**:
    
    - This is a more developmental approach. The leader does everything possible to help people succeed in their own right and become leaders themselves.
    
    - They help people transform themselves and achieve more than was originally intended.
    
    - This approach primarily addresses the second goal of leadership (inspiring the team) and is reflected in the many leadership models that link the style of the leader to the development and maturity of the team being led.

## Leadership Models and Contextual Factors

- The temporary nature of the P3 environment means teams come together for a specific purpose and are then disbanded. This dynamic context requires an adaptable leadership style.

- **Situational Leadership**:
    
    - Models of teamwork (like Tuckman's "forming, storming, norming, performing") show that teams go through distinct development stages.
    
    - Leadership models (like Hersey and Blanchard's Situational Leadership or Blake and Mouton's Managerial Grid) show how the leader’s style must adapt in parallel with the progression of the team.
    
    - For example, a new team may need a more directive style, while a mature, high-performing team requires a more supportive, delegating style. This is the essence of **situational leadership**.

- **Individual Motivation**:
    
    - Teams are made up of individuals, and different individuals are motivated by different things.
    
    - The P3 manager needs to understand the basic principles of motivation (explained in models like Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory) to understand both the individuals in the team and their collective development stage.

- **The Life Cycle**:
    - The project, programme, or portfolio life cycle is another unique variable. Different types of teams may be required at different phases, and the nature of conflict also changes as the work progresses.

- **Action-Centred Leadership**:
    - John Adair’s model brings these aspects together, looking at how a leader must constantly balance the needs of the **Task** (the objectives), the **Team**, and the **Individual**.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Ultimately, the position of leader is "granted" by followers who make a conscious decision to follow. That decision will be influenced by the leader using an appropriate style that takes account of the situation, the task, and the readiness of the people to follow. An individual's readiness to follow will also depend on their perception of the leader's "power" (e.g., expert power, legitimate power, referent power).

### The Challenge for the P3 Manager

> [!WARNING]  
> Every individual has their own preferred, natural style of leadership. By far the hardest part of leadership for a P3 manager is having to consciously exhibit different styles of leadership for different teams at different phases of the life cycle, most of which will not be their preferred style.

## Leadership in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Small Projects

- The relationship between a leader and their team takes time to develop. Small projects with short lifecycles present a difficult situation for the prospective leader.

- The project manager must develop a relationship with the team very quickly.

- This is often compounded by the fact that the project exists in a **matrix organisation**, where team members also report to departmental managers.

- In this context, the departmental managers hold the default "legitimate power" and most of the "reward power". The project manager must therefore seek to develop their own legitimate power alongside **"expert power"** (based on their skill) and **"referent power"** (based on charisma and respect).

- Referent power is greatly enhanced by having a strong **sponsor** who is visibly committed to the project's objectives.

- In a mature organisation, team members are more familiar with the project management context and have higher levels of what Hersey and Blanchard call "follower readiness", making the leader's job easier.

### Large, Complex Projects and Programmes

- As projects become more complex and longer, there is more time to develop the leader-follower relationship, apply the principles of situational leadership, and guide the team through its development stages.

- **Leading Leaders**: A project manager must be a strong leader but must also be able to be an effective follower and team member in the context of the wider programme or portfolio they belong to.

- **The Challenge of Scale**: On large programmes and portfolios, the primary leadership issue becomes one of **scale**. The P3 manager may be more detached from individuals or entire teams.

- While some of the more managerial aspects of leadership will be delegated, the programme/portfolio manager must still provide high-level **visionary leadership** for the initiative as a whole. This is an aspect of leadership that the P3 manager shares with their sponsor, and a visibly effective partnership between them will greatly increase the chances of success.

### Programme Leadership Style

- The nature of a programme influences the required leadership style:
    
    - The objectives are more **visionary and fluid** than a project's concrete specifications. A vision is more difficult to communicate and requires a different leadership approach.
    
    - Many of the people who need to be led are themselves **leaders** (project managers, business change managers). A programme manager must establish credibility with a team of leaders, especially when the needs of the programme conflict with the needs of an individual project.
    
    - **Change management** affects a wide range of stakeholders, requiring a leadership style based on influence and communication.
    
    - A programme manager is less likely to gain authority through "expert power" (as they cannot be an expert in all the component projects) and more through visionary leadership ("charisma" or "referent" power).

### Portfolio Leadership

- Leadership of a structured portfolio is the **most visionary in nature**.

- The single purpose of the portfolio is to deliver the host organisation’s strategy.

- Developing follower commitment to the vision of the portfolio is almost synonymous with developing commitment to the corporate vision and strategy.

- This kind of direct connection between leadership, the portfolio, and corporate strategy is a typical characteristic of a mature organisation.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the two primary goals of leadership in a P3 context?
    - **A:** 1. To provide focus and promote commitment to objectives, and 2. To inspire team members to successfully achieve those objectives.

- **Q:** What is the difference between transactional and transformational leadership?
    - **A:** **Transactional** leadership is an exchange process focused on agreeing on requirements and rewards. **Transformational** leadership is a developmental process focused on helping people succeed and become leaders themselves.

- **Q:** What is "situational leadership"?
    - **A:** The principle that a leader's style must adapt to match the development stage and maturity of the team they are leading.

- **Q:** What is the biggest leadership challenge for a P3 manager in a matrix organisation?
    - **A:** Team members have other departmental managers who hold the legitimate and reward power. The project manager must therefore develop their own expert and referent power to lead effectively.

- **Q:** How does the required leadership style change from a project to a programme?
    - **A:** It becomes less about technical expertise and more about being visionary, leading other leaders (the project and business change managers), and managing change across a wide range of stakeholders.
