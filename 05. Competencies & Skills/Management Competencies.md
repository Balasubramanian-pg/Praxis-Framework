# Management Competencies

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Management Competencies

## General Principles of Management Competencies

- **Definition**: This section of the Praxis Framework includes the competencies that relate directly to the functions described in the **management** part of the Praxis **Knowledge** section.

- It defines the required knowledge and performance criteria for an individual to be considered competent in performing these core P3 management functions.

## Structure of Management Competencies

- Just like the management part of the Knowledge section, these competencies are divided into two main parts:
    
    1. **Delivery Competencies**: These relate to the technical and procedural functions required to deliver the work (e.g., Scope Management, Risk Management, Financial Management).
    
    2. **Interpersonal Competencies**: These relate to the "soft skills" required to effectively lead and interact with people (e.g., Leadership, Communication, Negotiation).

## Relationship with Context Functions

- The **context functions** (e.g., Complexity, Environment) from the Knowledge section **do not have corresponding competencies**. These functions describe the environment _in which_ the work takes place, rather than activities that an individual performs.

### The Sponsorship Exception

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> There is one important exception to this rule: the Sponsorship function.
> 
> While Sponsorship is a function within the "Context" section of Knowledge, it also has an equivalent **Sponsorship Process** in the Praxis Method.
> 
> Therefore, the competency for the Sponsorship _function_ is covered by the competency defined for the Sponsorship _process_. This ensures that the required skills for being an effective sponsor are fully defined within the competency framework.
