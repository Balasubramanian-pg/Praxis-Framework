# Comprehensive Study Notes: Delegation

## General Principles of Delegation

- **Definition**: Delegation is the practice of giving a person or group the **authority and responsibility** to perform specific activities on behalf of another.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The act of delegation does not transfer accountability. The person who has delegated the work remains accountable for its results.

### The Goals of Delegation

- The primary goals of delegation in a P3 context are to:
    
    1. Allocate work **effectively** to individuals, teams, and suppliers within the project, programme, or portfolio.
    
    2. Use delegation as a **motivation and development tool** for team members.

### The Delegation Procedure

- Delegating a work package or task can be seen as a microcosm of the wider P3 environment, sharing many of the same principles. The procedure involves several key steps:
    
    1. **Define and Confirm**: Define the task or work package and confirm that it is something that can and should be delegated.
    
    2. **Select and Assess**: Select a team or individual to perform the work, assess their capability to do it, and identify any training needs.
    
    3. **Specify Role and Outputs**: The manager must clearly specify _what_ needs to be done (the outputs/scope) and also explain the _role_, including the degree of responsibility and authority being transferred.
    
    4. **Agree Resources and Timescales**: Discuss and agree on the resources needed and the required timescales for delivery.
    
    5. **Supervise and Support**: Once the work is underway, the manager should exercise a suitable degree of supervision and provide support as required, without micromanaging.
    
    6. **Provide Feedback**: Feedback should be useful throughout the procedure, but it is formally shown at the end where feedback on the end result is delivered.

### Delegation as a Tool for Motivation and Development

- Delegation is not just a mechanism for distributing work; it is also a powerful tool for motivating teams and individuals to realise their full potential.

- It underpins a style of management that encourages project team members to use and develop their skills and knowledge, leading to greater job satisfaction and capability growth.

- Models that illustrate leadership and teamwork, such as the **Tannenbaum and Schmidt continuum**, often reference delegation in the context of skilled leaders empowering high-performing teams. This continuum shows the relationship between a manager’s use of authority and the corresponding freedom available to the delegated resources.

### Obstacles to Effective Delegation

- There are numerous potential obstacles, both personal and organisational, in the path of effective delegation. These include:
    
    - Complex lines of authority in a **matrix organisation**.
    
    - The inability of the P3 manager to select the members of their own teams.
    
    - A **blame culture** where an intolerance of mistakes makes people reluctant to accept responsibility.
    
    - A manager's personal **reluctance to delegate** (often expressed as, "By the time I’ve explained it, I could have done it myself.").

> [!NOTE]  
> Delegation is an essential component of developing high-performing teams. A competent P3 manager must develop the skills to overcome these personal and organisational obstacles.

## Delegation in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

- The principles of delegation are at the very heart of any project, programme, or portfolio method. Delegation is the mechanism by which the entire structure of P3 management functions.
    
    - **Portfolios** delegate work to programmes and projects.
    
    - **Programmes** delegate the production of outputs to projects and delegate change management activities to business change teams.
    
    - **Projects** delegate work packages to suppliers and sub-projects.

### The Chain of Delegation

- As the size and complexity of the work increase, so do the levels within the management organisation.

- One of the effects of this is that people become both **delegators and delegatees**.

- **Example**: A programme manager receives delegated authority from the programme sponsor. That same programme manager then acts as the sponsor for the component projects within the programme and delegates authority and responsibility to the project managers accordingly.

### Knowing What to Delegate

- Anyone who is a link in this chain of delegation must consider carefully what can and cannot be delegated. This is why the first step in the delegation procedure is to "confirm that the task is something that can be delegated."

- **Example**: A sponsor will delegate the task of _preparing_ a business case to the manager, but they **cannot** delegate the _authority to approve_ the business case. That accountability remains with the sponsor.

### Delegation and Change

- An important element of delegation in the dynamic P3 environment is the effect of **change**.

- While a task may be clearly defined and delegated, it is inter-related with many other tasks and is therefore subject to change.

- Everyone within the P3 environment should expect change. What undermines the beneficial effects of delegation is **uncontrolled change**.
    
    - At the **project level**, a formal **change control** process will address changes to scope.
    
    - At the **portfolio level**, the co-ordination process will communicate the effects of links and changes between delegated parcels of work.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> At all levels, the delegator has a responsibility to keep the delegatee fully informed. This means not only communicating the changes to the work itself but also taking the time to explain the reasons for the change. This maintains trust and ensures the delegatee remains aligned with the overall objectives.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** When a manager delegates a task, what happens to the accountability for that task?
    - **A:** The accountability remains with the manager who delegated the work. It is not transferred.

- **Q:** What are the two primary goals of delegation?
    - **A:** 1. To allocate work effectively, and 2. To use delegation as a motivation and development tool.

- **Q:** What is a common personal reason a manager might be reluctant to delegate?
    - **A:** The belief that "By the time I’ve explained it, I could have done it myself."

- **Q:** Give an example of how someone can be both a delegator and a delegatee.
    - **A:** A programme manager is a delegatee of the programme sponsor but acts as a delegator when sponsoring and assigning work to their project managers.

- **Q:** When delegated work has to be changed, what is the delegator's key responsibility to the delegatee?
    - **A:** To keep them fully informed by explaining not just the changes to the work, but also the reasons for the change.
