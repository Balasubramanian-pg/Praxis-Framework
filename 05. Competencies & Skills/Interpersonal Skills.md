# Interpersonal Skills

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Interpersonal Skills

## General Principles of Interpersonal Skills

- Interpersonal skills are essential for P3 sponsors, managers, and team members to understand the mechanisms by which people relate to and interact with each other.

- While subdividing the complexities of human behaviour into distinct functions can be somewhat artificial and theoretical, using simple models provides a useful starting point for individuals to build their own interpersonal skill-set.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The fundamental principles of interpersonal skills do not vary across the range of projects, programmes, and portfolios. However, the context and organisational structures do change, which leads to different challenges and a different emphasis in how these skills are applied.

- When a manager applies these skills with **professionalism** and within an **ethical framework**, they will engender the **trust and respect** that are critical for success.

## The Praxis Wheel of Interpersonal Skills

- The Praxis framework illustrates seven key interpersonal skills in a wheel model, with the **P3 Manager at its center**.

- The skills can be loosely arranged into two groups: those that are primarily **team-oriented** and those that are primarily **stakeholder-oriented**.

### The Seven Core Skills

1. **Leadership** (at the top, bridging both groups)

2. **Motivation** (team-oriented)

3. **Teamwork** (team-oriented)

4. **Delegation** (team-oriented)

5. **Influencing** (stakeholder-oriented)

6. **Negotiation** (stakeholder-oriented)

7. **Conflict Management** (applies to all interactions)

8. **Communication** (at the heart of the wheel, central to all skills)

## Breakdown of Key Skills and Their Application

### Leadership

- **Position**: Leadership appears at the top of the wheel, as it is a primary function of the manager.

- **Application**: A manager must lead both their internal teams and the external stakeholder community, but the approach for each is different.
    
    - **Leading Teams**: This involves two types of leadership:
        
        - **Visionary Leadership**: Ensuring team members understand and are committed to the objectives of the work.
        
        - **Managerial Leadership**: The practical application of leadership through delegating work and actively developing teamwork.
    
    - **Leading Stakeholders**: The stakeholder community does not form a collective team, and delegation is rarely appropriate. Leadership here is expressed more through influencing and negotiation.

### Team-Oriented Skills

- **Motivation**: A key part of leadership is the ability to motivate the management and delivery teams.

- **Delegation**: This is a core component of managerial leadership, used to assign work effectively within the team.

- **Teamwork**: This is a quality that a manager must consciously develop within their teams as part of their leadership role.

### Stakeholder-Oriented Skills

- **Influencing**: When dealing with stakeholders (to whom you cannot delegate), influencing is a more relevant and necessary skill to gain support and alignment.

- **Negotiation**: This skill is used to reach agreements and resolve differences with stakeholders.

> [!NOTE]  
> When dealing with particularly senior or vital stakeholders, the P3 manager will inevitably need to call upon the support of the sponsor, who can leverage their authority and influence.

### Foundational Skills for All Interactions

- **Conflict Management**:
    
    - Conflict will inevitably arise in some form, whether you are delegating work to a team or influencing stakeholders.
    
    - A manager must have effective conflict management skills, no matter how well-honed their other interpersonal skills may be.

- **Communication**:
    
    - Positioned at the heart of all human interactions.
    
    - It is the central skill that enables all others to be performed effectively.
