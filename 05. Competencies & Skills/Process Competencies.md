# Process Competencies

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Process Competencies

## General Principles of Process Competencies

- **Definition**: Process competencies are one of three groups of competencies in the Praxis Framework, alongside **delivery** and **interpersonal** competencies.

- **Alignment**: They align directly with the **processes** described in the **Method** section of the Praxis Framework.

- **Purpose**: They define the knowledge and performance criteria required for an individual to be considered competent in the practical enactment and management of the P3 life cycle phases. They are about being able to successfully navigate a project, programme, or portfolio through its entire life cycle.

## The Relationship Between Processes and Competencies

- As with the other competency groups, there is a direct one-to-one relationship between the processes in the Method section and the process competencies.

- The **process** (from the Method section) describes _what_ happens in a life cycle phase, its goals, and its constituent activities (the theory).

- The **competency** (from the Competence section) describes the ability to _enact and manage_ that process successfully (the practice).

### Naming Convention: Process vs. Competency

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The titles of the competencies reflect the fact that competency is about the active implementation of the processes, rather than simply describing what the processes are.

- This is illustrated by a simple change in the naming convention from a noun (the process) to a verb (the competency).
    
    - The process is called the **Identification Process**.
    
    - The corresponding competency is called **Identify a project or programme**.
    
    - The process is called the **Definition Process**.
    
    - The corresponding competency is called **Define a project or programme**.
    
    - The process is called the **Closure Process**.
    
    - The corresponding competency is called **Close a project or programme**.

- This shift in language emphasizes that a competency is not about knowing the theory of the identification process; it is about being able to _actually execute_ that process to take an idea and develop it into a viable brief.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the three groups of competencies in the Praxis Framework?
    - **A:** Delivery, Interpersonal, and Process competencies.

- **Q:** What do Process Competencies align with in the Praxis Framework?
    - **A:** They align with the **processes** in the **Method** section of Praxis.

- **Q:** How does the naming convention for process competencies reflect their purpose?
    - **A:** They use a verb (e.g., "Identify a project") instead of a noun (e.g., "Identification Process") to emphasize that competency is about the active implementation and enactment of the process.

- **Q:** The competency "Define a project or programme" corresponds to which process in the Praxis Method?
    - **A:** The Definition Process.
