# Delivery Competencies

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Delivery Competencies

## General Principles of Delivery Competencies

- **Definition**: Delivery competencies are the set of competencies that align directly with the **delivery functions** in the Knowledge section of the Praxis Framework.

- **Purpose**: They define the knowledge and performance criteria required for an individual to be considered competent in the practical application and implementation of the core technical and procedural functions of P3 management.

## Relationship Between Functions and Competencies

- There is a direct one-to-one relationship between the delivery functions and the delivery competencies.

- The **function** (from the Knowledge section) describes _what_ the area of management is and the principles and procedures involved (the theory).

- The **competency** (from the Competence section) describes the ability to _apply and implement_ that function successfully (the practice).

### Naming Convention: Function vs. Competency

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The titles of the competencies reflect the fact that competency is about the active implementation of the functions, rather than simply describing what the functions are.

- This is illustrated by a simple change in the naming convention from a noun (the function) to a verb (the competency).
    
    - The function is called **Stakeholder Management**.
    
    - The corresponding competency is called **Manage Stakeholders**.
    
    - The function is called **Risk Management**.
    
    - The corresponding competency is called **Manage Risk**.
    
    - The function is called **Scope Management**.
    
    - The corresponding competency is called **Manage Scope**.

- This subtle shift in language emphasizes that a competency is not about knowing the theory of stakeholder management; it is about being able to _actually manage stakeholders_ effectively in a real-world project, programme, or portfolio environment.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What do Delivery Competencies align with in the Praxis Framework?
    - **A:** They align with the **delivery functions** in the Knowledge section of Praxis.

- **Q:** What is the key difference between a "function" and a "competency" in Praxis?
    - **A:** A **function** describes the area of management (the theory). A **competency** describes the ability to apply and implement that function in practice.

- **Q:** How does the naming convention for competencies reflect their purpose?
    - **A:** The titles use a verb (e.g., "Manage Stakeholders") instead of a noun (e.g., "Stakeholder Management") to emphasize that competency is about active implementation and application.
