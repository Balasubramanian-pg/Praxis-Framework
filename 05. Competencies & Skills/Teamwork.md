# Comprehensive Study Notes: Teamwork

## General Principles of Teamwork

- **Definition**: Teamwork is how a group of people come together to **collaborate and co-operate** in achieving common objectives.

- **Team vs. Group**: The key difference between a team and a group of individuals is the team’s **collective commitment** to a set of agreed-upon objectives.

### Goals of Teamwork

- The primary goals of teamwork in a P3 context are to:
    
    1. Create a cohesive **team** from a collection of individuals.
    
    2. Develop and maintain the high **performance** of that team.

### Teamwork in the P3 Context

- **Temporary Nature**: The main distinguishing factor of project, programme, and portfolio teams is their temporary nature. A P3 manager needs to build a team as quickly as possible and maintain its performance against the backdrop of its eventual demobilisation.

- **The Right People**: It helps considerably if the individuals who make up the team are comfortable with, or actively enjoy, the dynamic and temporary environment of P3 management.

- **Organisational Maturity**: Familiarity with the nature of P3 work throughout an organisation naturally arises from higher levels of capability maturity and functions like communities of practice.

## Models of Teamwork

- Models of teamwork tend to address two key aspects:
    
    1. The nature of the **individuals** who make up the team.
    
    2. The developmental **stages** of the team as a whole.

### 1. Team Composition Models (The Individuals)

- Models like **Belbin's Team Roles** or **Margerison-McCann's Team Management Profile** illustrate how different personalities and preferred working styles can work together to create a balanced and effective team.

- Each personality type or "role" has its strengths and weaknesses. Ideally, within a team, one person’s strengths will balance another person's weaknesses.

- Individuals will perform better in a team context if they are given a role that plays to their natural strengths.

> [!CAUTION]  
> P3 managers are rarely in the position of a sports manager who can select a perfectly balanced team. The make-up of a P3 management team is more typically composed of people who are available at the time. Such teams are unlikely to form an ideal combination of team roles. The manager must therefore work with the individuals they have to develop behaviours that may not be their natural style but are needed by the team.

### 2. Team Development Models (The Stages)

- Once assembled, teams do not instantly become high-performing. They typically go through a series of development stages.

- Models like **Tuckman's "forming, storming, norming, performing"** or **Katzenbach & Smith's Team Performance Curve** illustrate this journey.

- P3 managers must be aware of where a team is in its development cycle and adjust their **leadership style** to suit that stage (e.g., being more directive in "forming" and more delegating in "performing").

### The Link Between Team Cycle and Project Life Cycle

- The team development cycle and the project or programme life cycle are related.

- Research by Thamhain and Wilemon showed how the varying levels of conflict that naturally occur in the project life cycle follow a similar pattern to the varying levels of conflict in a team cycle like Tuckman’s.

- **Example**: A P3 manager needs to be prepared for the high potential for conflict that arises when a team in its "storming" phase is working on the project's "definition" phase, a time when requirements and plans are being debated.

## Maintaining Team Performance

- Once established, a P3 manager is responsible for the continued cohesion and performance of the team.

- They should strive to keep individuals motivated and support them in their personal and career development aspirations.

- In a **matrix organisation**, this means the P3 manager must have a good working relationship with the team member’s line manager.

### Challenges to Team Performance

- **Change**: A common focus on well-defined objectives is a powerful tool for developing a team. However, in the P3 context, objectives are susceptible to change. If a team is highly focused on a set of objectives, frequent and uncontrolled change can be very demotivating.
    - In environments where change is common, an **agile approach** may be chosen. This requires a team with a different mind-set, as agile teams are often self-organising and use techniques designed to embrace change.

- **Virtual Teams**: In the digital age, the P3 manager faces the additional challenge of maintaining a sense of teamwork among members who are not physically co-located and may be spread across different offices, continents, and time zones.

## Teamwork in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Projects

- Projects are where the most close-knit, traditional teams will be found.

- In a typical project, the objectives are well-defined and broken down into a series of specified products, providing a clear focus for the team’s efforts.

- Functions such as **scope management, planning, and communication** are not just core P3 management functions; they are also, in effect, **team development functions** because they provide the clarity and structure a new team needs.

### Programmes

- In programmes, the P3 manager delegates portions of the work to various sub-teams. This means they are delegating responsibility for **team development** as well as for delivery.

- A programme manager needs to develop teamwork within multiple sub-teams concurrently, such as:
    
    - The central programme management team.
    
    - A "team" of project managers.
    
    - A "team" of business change managers.

- The team working approach can also be applied to groups who do not typically regard themselves as a team but who could benefit from a team culture, for example, a "team" of key suppliers or stakeholders.

- The programme manager must create a cohesive **team ethos for the programme as a whole**, despite the significant turnover of team members as projects start and finish.

### Portfolios

- The principles of team working are not as visible in the portfolio context.

- Other than the core portfolio management team, the high levels of interaction associated with traditional team working are not present.

- Wider groups of individuals with responsibility for delivering different parts of the portfolio are, in effect, a **collaborative team**, but this is not always immediately obvious to those involved.

- It is in the interest of the portfolio that the appropriate type of team working (collaboration and co-operation with a shared vision of the strategic objectives) is encouraged and exploited at all levels to maximise the portfolio's effectiveness.

> [!NOTE]  
> Maintaining a team ethos across the broad, diverse, and constantly changing communities within a programme or portfolio will require excellent communication and leadership skills on the part of the P3 manager, closely supported by the sponsor.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is the key difference between a "team" and a "group"?
    - **A:** A team has a collective commitment to agreed objectives.

- **Q:** Name the two main aspects that models of teamwork tend to address.
    - **A:** 1. The nature of the individuals who make up the team (e.g., Belbin), and 2. The developmental stages of the team as a whole (e.g., Tuckman).

- **Q:** Why is it often difficult for a P3 manager to create a perfectly balanced team?
    - **A:** Because P3 teams are typically made up of people who are available at the time, rather than being selected for their ideal team roles.

- **Q:** What is the relationship between the team development cycle and a P3 manager's leadership style?
    - **A:** The manager must be aware of where the team is in its development cycle (e.g., storming) and adjust their leadership style to suit that stage.

- **Q:** How does teamwork differ between a project and a programme?
    - **A:** A project typically has a single, close-knit team. A programme manager must develop teamwork within multiple sub-teams (e.g., a team of project managers, a team of business change managers) and create a cohesive ethos for the programme as a whole.
