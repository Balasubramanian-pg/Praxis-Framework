# Comprehensive Study Notes: Competence

## General Principles of Competence

- **Definition**: At its core, competence is the ability of an individual to perform a job or role successfully.
    
    - A competent project manager is someone who can successfully manage a project.
    
    - A competent programme manager is someone who can successfully manage a programme.
    
    - And so on for all P3 management roles.

### The Goals of Competence (within the Praxis Framework)

- In the context of a structured framework like Praxis, the goals of defining competence are to:
    
    - Define clear criteria that enable competence to be identified and assessed in individuals.
    
    - Provide a means of integrating the competencies of individual functions (e.g., risk management) and processes (e.g., the delivery process) to support and build overall organisational **capability maturity**.

### Competence in the Wider Context of Success

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The competence of a single individual, such as the project manager, is not a guarantee that a project will be delivered successfully. Success is a team effort that relies on the competence of many different people.

- There are too many other factors at play. The overall success of an initiative depends on the competence of:
    
    - The **Sponsor**.
    
    - The members of the **management team**.
    
    - The members of the **delivery team**.
    
    - Even influential **stakeholders** (in terms of their competence in fulfilling their role as a stakeholder, not just their day job).

- Because the deployment of competent people across all these roles is so critical, it is a key characteristic of **level 2 capability maturity**. The competencies defined in the Praxis Framework are designed to describe how an individual should perform in an organisation operating at that level.

## Competency Frameworks

- The idea of an individual being "competent" inevitably leads to the question: "What does competent look like?"

- Many organisations seek to answer this question by creating and using a **competency framework**.

- **Definition**: A competency framework is a structured set of competencies, where a **competency** is a detailed definition of the attributes (knowledge, skills, behaviours) that an individual must have, or acquire, to perform a role effectively.

- **Structure in Praxis**: In the Praxis competency framework, competencies are defined for the topics that make up the discipline. These topics are the:
    
    - Management functions in the **Knowledge** section (e.g., Scope Management, Finance Management).
    
    - Processes in the **Method** section (e.g., Identification Process, Definition Process).

### Uses of a Competency Framework

- Competency frameworks are practical tools that can be used for a variety of HR and management purposes, such as:
    
    - Defining clear and consistent **role descriptions**.
    
    - Conducting structured, **competency-based interviewing**.
    
    - Performing **competency assessments** to identify individual and team learning and development needs.
    
    - Conducting fair and objective **competency-based appraisals**.

## The Components of a Competency

- In theory, a comprehensive competency can be defined in terms of four key components: knowledge, performance, experience, and behaviour.

- **Example: The function of Risk Management**
    
    - **Knowledge**: "Knows and understands various techniques for assessing threats and opportunities." (What they need to know).
    
    - **Performance**: "Is able to assess the probability and impact of given risk events." (What they need to be able to do).
    
    - **Experience**: "Has managed others who were practising risk assessment on complex projects." (What they have done in the past).
    
    - **Behaviour**: "Is prepared to take calculated risks to achieve worthwhile objectives." (How they tend to act).

> [!TIP]  
> Experience and behaviour are often highly sensitive to the specific environment and context in which the competency is being applied. For this reason, generic competency frameworks (like those found in Praxis) more often define competencies in terms of knowledge and performance. The more context-specific elements of experience and behaviour are then typically added as part of a full role description for a specific job in a specific organisation.

## Applying Competence Frameworks in Practice

- The specific competencies required for any project, programme, portfolio, or role will vary to some degree according to the unique environment and context of the work.

- **The Key Benefit**: The primary benefit of a competency framework is its flexibility. Individual competencies can be combined in different ways to create different roles that are appropriate to any given environment.

- Therefore, the full competence required for a particular role in a specific environment is a **combination of selected competencies** taken from the framework.

- Even then, these selected competencies may need to be further **tailored** to suit the specific situations and challenges of the work.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is the basic definition of a "competent" project manager?
    - **A:** Someone who is able to successfully manage a project.

- **Q:** Why is a competent project manager not a guarantee of project success?
    - **A:** Because success also depends on the competence of the sponsor, the management and delivery teams, and even the stakeholders.

- **Q:** The deployment of competent people is a characteristic of which level of capability maturity?
    - **A:** Level 2.

- **Q:** What are the four main uses of a competency framework?
    - **A:** Defining role descriptions, competency-based interviewing, competency assessment for development needs, and competency-based appraisals.

- **Q:** What are the four components that make up a competency?
    - **A:** Knowledge, Performance, Experience, and Behaviour.

- **Q:** Why do generic competency frameworks often focus only on knowledge and performance?
    - **A:** Because experience and behaviour are more sensitive to the specific environment and are better added as part of a detailed role description.
