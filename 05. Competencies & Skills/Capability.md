# Capability

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Capability

## General Principles of Capability

- **Definition**: Capability, in the Praxis Framework, refers to an organisation's ability to perform a specific P3 management **function** (e.g., risk management, scope management) effectively and consistently.

- **Structure**: To reach a certain level of capability for a function, an organisation must achieve two types of goals:
    
    1. The **generic goals** that apply to all functions at that level.
    
    2. The **specific goals** of that particular function.

- **Cumulative Nature**: The goals are cumulative. This means to reach level 3 in a function, the organisation must have achieved all the generic and specific goals for both level 2 and level 3.

---

## The Capability Levels

### Level 0: Incomplete

- The function is rarely, if ever, performed in a way that is consistent with its description in the Praxis Knowledge section.

- This level represents a lack of formal, recognisable P3 management.

### Level 1: Performed (Ad-Hoc)

- The function achieves its goals, but it does so in an **ad-hoc manner**.

- This is the key factor, regardless of any other specific attributes.

- Level 1 represents an organisation that manages to achieve its goals primarily through the work, talent, and "heroics" of a few skilled individuals, rather than through established processes.

### Level 2: Managed (Effective)

- The goals are generally achieved using **competent people** (as described in the Praxis competency framework) who follow a planned and managed process.

- At this level, P3 management is **effective** (it gets the job done), but it could be more **efficient** (it may not be done in the most streamlined or cost-effective way).

### Level 3: Defined (Efficient and Consistent)

- The organisation actively **co-ordinates** P3 management to achieve efficiencies.

- Good practice is consistent across the organisation and is embedded in the organisational culture.

- The function is performed using a centrally defined standard approach that is **tailored** to the context of each specific project or programme.

## Generic Goals of Capability

- These are the goals that apply to _any_ function to achieve a certain level of capability.

### Level 2 Generic Goals

- Establish an organisational **policy** for performing the function.

- Develop and maintain a **plan** for the function.

- Provide sufficient, **competent resources** for performing the function.

- Assign **responsibility and authority** for performing the function.

- **Monitor and control** the function.

- Perform **assurance** on the function.

### Level 3 Generic Goals

- Establish centrally defined **procedures and practices**.

- **Tailor** these procedures and practices to suit the specific context.

- Perform **independent assurance** of the function.

- Collect and utilise **lessons learned**.

---

## Generic Attributes and Indicators

- The achievement of the generic goals is demonstrated through a set of attributes, which are grouped by common indicators.

### Overall Description

- **Level 1**: The function is performed in an ad-hoc manner and succeeds through individual effort.

- **Level 2**: An organisational policy exists. The function is performed by competent people according to a plan. It is monitored and controlled.

- **Level 3**: The plan for the function is based on a centrally defined approach that is tailored to the context. Lessons learned are collected and utilised.

### Indicators and Attributes Table

|Indicator|Level 1 Attributes|Level 2 Attributes|Level 3 Attributes|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Roles & Responsibilities**|No formal responsibilities are assigned.|Role descriptions contain responsibilities for the function.|Role descriptions conform to organisational standards, tailored to the context. Statements of authority are documented.|
|**Information Management**|Some ad-hoc, incomplete documentation exists.|Sufficient documentation exists, but it is inconsistent across different projects.|All documentation is based on organisational standards, has been tailored to the context, and is under configuration control.|
|**Assurance**|The function is not assessed.|The function is checked to ensure it is being performed effectively.|The function is independently checked to ensure it is based on standards, has been tailored, and is being performed effectively.|
|**Budget**|No identified budget for performing the function itself.|Budgets exist for all aspects of performing the function.|Budgets exist and include costs estimated according to organisational standards.|
|**Interfaces**|Interfaces between this and other functions are not understood.|Interfaces are understood and documented.|Interfaces are understood, documented, and acted upon in a consistent manner across the organisation.|
|**Plan**|Some evidence of tools/techniques, but no formal procedures.|A management plan exists for the performance of the function.|A standard management plan exists, with adjustments to suit the context. It is continually reviewed.|
|**Initiate**||Members of the management team are competent in the function.|All relevant roles include responsibilities and performance criteria in their descriptions.|
|**Specific Goals**|||The procedural attributes designed to achieve the specific goals of each individual function are described in their respective sections.|

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is the key difference between a Level 1 ("Performed") and a Level 2 ("Managed") capability?
    - **A:** At Level 1, the function is performed in an ad-hoc way, succeeding through individual heroics. At Level 2, it is performed consistently according to a defined policy and plan by competent people.

- **Q:** To achieve Level 3 capability in a function, what must an organisation have already achieved?
    - **A:** It must have achieved all the generic and specific goals for both Level 2 and Level 3, as the levels are cumulative.

- **Q:** What are the two key activities that distinguish Level 3 capability from Level 2?
    - **A:** The use of a centrally defined standard procedure that is **tailored** to the context, and the systematic collection and utilisation of **lessons learned**.

- **Q:** What is the relationship between competence and capability?
    - **A:** Achieving Level 2 capability requires that the function is performed by **competent people**, as defined in the Praxis competency framework.

- **Q:** How does documentation differ between Level 2 and Level 3?
    - **A:** At Level 2, documentation is sufficient but often inconsistent between projects. At Level 3, all documentation is based on organisational standards, has been tailored to the context, and is under formal configuration control.
