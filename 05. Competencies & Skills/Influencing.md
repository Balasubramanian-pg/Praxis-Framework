# Comprehensive Study Notes: Influencing

## General Principles of Influencing

- **Definition**: A P3 manager will often be in a position where the exercise of direct authority is either inappropriate or impossible. In these situations, the manager must seek to affect the behaviours and actions of others through **influence** rather than direct authority.

### The Goals of Influencing

- The primary goals of influencing in a P3 context are to:
    
    1. Develop and maintain a high-performing **team**.
    
    2. Persuade **stakeholders** to support the _objectives_ of the work.
    
    3. Persuade **stakeholders** to support the _achievement_ of those objectives (e.g., by providing resources or removing obstacles).

### Influencing Teams vs. Stakeholders

- **Influencing Teams**:
    
    - Leadership models (like Hersey and Blanchard's Situational Leadership) and teamwork models (like Tuckman's stages of group development) show a common theme: as a team matures and develops, the manager’s style must change from being **authoritative** to being **supportive**.
    
    - In a high-performing team with a supportive manager, one of the manager’s key skills will be influencing. The manager is not so much telling the team members what to do as influencing them to do the right thing and make the right decisions.

- **Influencing Stakeholders**:
    
    - While influencing is a useful skill to back up authority within a team, it is an **essential skill** when the P3 manager has little or no formal authority over a person.
    
    - The stakeholder management function identifies numerous people that the P3 manager needs to influence. This influence may be required to overcome objections, secure resources, or even ask them to help influence others.

## The Practice of Influencing

- Models for the nature and practice of influencing (e.g., from Cialdini or Cohen & Bradford) emphasise two common and fundamental themes:
    
    1. You must first **understand the people** you wish to influence (their motivations, goals, and pressures).
    
    2. You must understand **what you can do for them** in return for what you want them to do for you (the principle of reciprocity or "currencies of exchange").

### Attributes of a Successful Influencer

- To achieve these two themes, a successful influencer will:
    
    - Understand their own behaviour and how it is perceived by others (self-awareness).
    
    - Have a clear vision of what the work involves and how it affects others.
    
    - **Communicate effectively** using all appropriate means.
    
    - **Negotiate** to find mutually acceptable solutions to issues.
    
    - Understand the **context**, including cultural, social, and political factors.
    
    - Behave **ethically** at all times to build and maintain trust.

### Sources of Power

- A P3 manager’s ability to influence is often based on different sources of power (as described by models like Montana and Charnov's). These can include formal authority (legitimate power), expertise (expert power), control over resources (reward power), or personal charisma (referent power).

- A manager must understand their own sources and levels of power so that they can be used constructively and are never abused.

### The Consequences of Influencing

- If successful, influencing will result in positive changes in the attitude and behaviour of those being influenced, leading to acceptance of and support for the work's objectives.

- Influencing can take many forms: it can be deliberate or accidental, overt or discrete, focused on one person or widespread.

- A P3 manager must habitually consider the consequences of their actions. An action to positively influence one person may inadvertently have a negative influence on another.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> While an individual’s ability to influence is based largely on their personality and behaviour, it is also dependent on their position in the organisation. Sometimes, even the most skilled P3 manager will need the support of their sponsor, simply because the influencing skills need to be backed up by the kind of authority or credibility that is linked to seniority.

## Influencing in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Projects

- A P3 manager has nominal authority over their team members, but in a **matrix organisation**, those same team members have other allegiances and report to functional managers.

- This means team members are subject to different, and sometimes conflicting, influences.

- The P3 manager needs to understand this context and will likely need to influence the other managers in the matrix to ensure they act in support of the project or programme.

### Programmes and Complex Projects

- Programmes (and some complex projects) include benefits realisation, which relies on **change management**.

- Implementing and embedding change in business-as-usual operations is not something that can be done through authority alone.

- People in the affected parts of the organisation must be encouraged to accept and support the proposed changes and to value the predicted benefits. All of this requires significant and sustained influencing skills.

### Programme-Level Co-ordination

- As the work becomes more complex, so do the relationships between all the various stakeholders.

- On a programme, a single stakeholder may be affected by multiple different projects.

- A programme manager needs to ensure that attempts to influence this stakeholder by different project managers are co-ordinated and are not counter-productive.

- The programme-level stakeholder management function will include co-ordinated communications aimed at influencing the stakeholder in a consistent way that has the greatest net benefit to the overall programme.

### Portfolio Level

- At the upper end of the complexity scale, portfolio management requires the involvement and support of executive teams and management boards throughout the host organisation.

- Strong **leadership from the very top** of the organisation is required to provide a background of authority for the portfolio's objectives.

- Strong **influencing skills** will be required from the portfolio manager and sponsor to address the complex web of competing interests and priorities inherent in a portfolio.

- This influencing role does not necessarily stop at the boundaries of the host organisation. A portfolio is often the most visible aspect of P3 management to the outside world. If the host organisation wishes to gain support from shareholders, public bodies, or customers, then influence must be available and exercised at the highest executive level.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** When is influencing a more appropriate skill for a P3 manager to use than direct authority?
    - **A:** When dealing with stakeholders over whom they have no formal authority, or when leading a high-performing, mature team.

- **Q:** What are the two fundamental themes of effective influencing?
    - **A:** 1. Understand the people you wish to influence, and 2. Understand what you can do for them in return for what you want them to do for you.

- **Q:** Name three key attributes of a successful influencer.
    - **A:** Any three from: self-awareness, clear vision, effective communication, negotiation skills, contextual understanding, and ethical behaviour.

- **Q:** Why is influencing particularly critical in a matrix organisation?
    - **A:** Because team members have multiple allegiances, and the P3 manager must influence not only their team but also the other functional managers to gain support.

- **Q:** What is the key influencing challenge for a programme manager regarding stakeholders?
    - **A:** To co-ordinate the influencing activities of their various project managers to ensure a consistent and non-conflicting message is delivered to stakeholders who are affected by multiple projects.
