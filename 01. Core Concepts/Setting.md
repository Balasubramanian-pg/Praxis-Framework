# Comprehensive Study Notes: The Setting in P3 Management

## Defining the Setting

- The **Setting** is one of the three core components of the P3 (Project, Programme, Portfolio) management context, alongside Governance and Professionalism.

- It can be likened to the **"nature"** aspect in a "nature vs. nurture" analogy. It represents the pre-existing conditions and inherent characteristics of the work and its surroundings.

- The setting is the primary factor that determines how the work will be managed and governed. It is the starting point for strategic-level P3 management.

- It comprises two main elements:
    
    - **The inherent nature of the work**, which is collectively defined by its **complexity**.
    
    - **The surrounding environment**, which consists of external factors that influence the work.

> [!NOTE]  
> Understanding and analyzing the setting is the crucial first step in P3 management. The choice of management methods, governance structures, and the required competencies of the team all depend on a thorough assessment of the setting.

## 1. Inherent Nature of the Work (Complexity)

- The inherent nature of any project, programme, or portfolio is determined by its objectives and the methods chosen to achieve them.

- These combined factors are grouped under the heading of **complexity**, which serves as a measure of how difficult the work will be to manage.

### Spectrum of Complexity

- **Low Complexity (Clear and Defined)**:
    
    - **Objectives**: The goals are clear, specific, measurable, and well-defined. There is little to no ambiguity about what needs to be delivered.
    
    - **Methods**: The approach to achieving the objectives involves tried-and-tested methods, familiar processes, and established technology.
    
    - **Example**: Constructing a standard residential house using conventional building techniques. The output is clear, and the delivery process is well-understood.

- **High Complexity (Ambiguous and Uncertain)**:
    
    - **Objectives**: The goals may be vague, ambiguous, or evolve over time. There might be conflicting expectations among stakeholders.
    
    - **Methods**: The path to achieving the objectives is uncertain due to the use of innovative or unfamiliar technology, novel processes, or a high degree of unpredictability.
    
    - **Example**: Developing a first-of-its-kind AI-driven medical diagnosis tool. The final capabilities are not fully known, and the technology is cutting-edge, leading to significant uncertainty.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Complexity is not just about the size or cost of the work. A small project can be highly complex if it involves new technology and ambiguous goals, while a large project can be relatively simple if it is repetitive and uses standard procedures.

### Factors Contributing to Complexity

- **Structural Complexity**: The number of different components and the relationships between them. This includes:
    
    - The number of tasks and their interdependencies.
    
    - The number and diversity of stakeholders involved.
    
    - The composition of the technical systems and organizational structures.

- **Dynamic Complexity**: The unpredictable behavior of the system over time. This is driven by:
    
    - Feedback loops and non-linear interactions.
    
    - Changes in the environment or requirements during the lifecycle.
    
    - Human behavior and decision-making under pressure.

- **Innovation-Related Complexity**: Arises from the degree of technical innovation. It involves the learning required to work with unfamiliar outcomes, approaches, and tools.

### Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is "complexity" in the P3 setting?
    - **A:** It is a measure of how difficult the work will be to manage, based on the clarity of its objectives and the certainty of the methods used to achieve them.

- **Q:** Give an example of a low-complexity objective versus a high-complexity one.
    - **A:** A low-complexity objective is building a defined product with known technology (e.g., a new website with standard features). A high-complexity objective is creating a strategic cultural change within an organization, where the outcomes are intangible and the path is uncertain.

- **Q:** What are the two main types of complexity?
    - **A:** Structural complexity (the number and variety of parts) and dynamic complexity (the unpredictable behavior of the system over time).

## 2. The Surrounding Environment

- The **environment** consists of the external factors that influence the nature of the work. These are the contextual forces that the project, programme, or portfolio must navigate.

### Key Environmental Factors

- **Organizational**:
    
    - The structure, culture, and P3 management maturity of the host organization.
    
    - The relationship and interfaces with the permanent, "business-as-usual" parts of the organization.
    
    - The availability of resources and competition for them.

- **Commercial**:
    
    - The contractual relationships with suppliers, partners, and clients.
    
    - The procurement strategy and financial arrangements.
    
    - Market conditions and competitive pressures.

- **Stakeholders**:
    
    - The number of stakeholders and the diversity of their interests, influence, and expectations.
    
    - The political landscape and informal strategies that may impact the work.

- **Geographical**:
    
    - The physical location of the work, team members, and stakeholders.
    
    - Challenges related to different time zones, cultures, and languages in distributed teams.

- **Regulatory and Legal**:
    - Applicable laws, industry standards, and government regulations that must be adhered to.

> [!WARNING]  
> The environment is often dynamic and can change unexpectedly. A stable organizational environment can become turbulent due to a merger, or new government regulations can suddenly impact a project's scope. Continuous environmental scanning is a critical management activity.

### Practical Example: Environmental Impact

- **Project A (Simple Environment)**: An internal IT upgrade within a single, co-located department of a supportive company. The organizational, stakeholder, and geographical factors are straightforward and contained.

- **Project B (Complex Environment)**: A major infrastructure project involving a public-private partnership (P3). The environment is highly complex due to:
    
    - **Organizational**: Interfaces with multiple government agencies and private companies.
    
    - **Stakeholder**: The need to manage politicians, public interest groups, contractors, and investors.
    
    - **Regulatory**: Compliance with extensive environmental, safety, and public procurement laws.
    
    - **Commercial**: Complex contracts that allocate financial and operational risks.

### Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is the "environment" in the P3 setting?
    - **A:** It is the collection of external factors—such as organizational, commercial, stakeholder, and regulatory—that influence the work.

- **Q:** How does a complex stakeholder environment affect management?
    - **A:** It increases the need for sophisticated communication, influencing, and integration skills to manage diverse expectations and potential conflicts.

- **Q:** Why is the organizational environment a key factor?
    - **A:** The host organization's culture, maturity, and structure determine the level of support, the availability of resources, and the reporting and decision-making processes the work must align with.

## 3. The Decision to Govern as a Project, Programme, or Portfolio

- A critical decision made early in the lifecycle is whether to structure and govern the work as a project, a programme, or a portfolio.

- This decision is heavily influenced by the **complexity of the scope and objectives**.

### Basis for the Decision

- **Project**: Typically chosen for work with a clear, single output or a tightly-related set of outputs. It has lower scope complexity.
    - **Focus**: Delivering a unique product, service, or result within defined constraints of time, cost, and quality.

- **Programme**: Chosen when work involves multiple, related projects that need to be coordinated to deliver outcomes and benefits that wouldn't be achieved by managing the projects individually. This implies a higher complexity of scope and a focus on managing interdependencies.
    - **Focus**: Achieving strategic change and realizing benefits.

- **Portfolio**: Represents the highest level of aggregation. It is a collection of projects and programmes that are grouped to achieve an organization's strategic business objectives. The components may not be related to each other except at a strategic level.
    - **Focus**: Optimizing investment, managing resources across all initiatives, and ensuring alignment with overall business strategy.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Once the decision is made to classify work as a project, programme, or portfolio, that classification itself becomes a fundamental part of the context. All subsequent applications of management functions, processes, and competencies (such as those outlined in the Praxis Framework) are tailored to fit that specific structure.

### Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is the primary factor that distinguishes whether work is a project or a programme?
    - **A:** The complexity of the scope and the nature of the objectives. Projects deliver outputs, while programmes coordinate multiple projects to deliver outcomes and benefits.

- **Q:** At what point does the classification of work (as a project, programme, or portfolio) become part of its context?
    - **A:** As soon as the initial decision is made early in the lifecycle. This decision shapes the entire governance and management approach that follows.
