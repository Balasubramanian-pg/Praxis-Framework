# Overview

# Overview

This section is so named  
because it aligns with guides that are frequently referred to as  
'Bodies of Knowledge'. The aim is to define the building blocks of the  
discipline of P3 management and is based on the concept of a functional  
analysis. The functions described in this section are split between [context](https://www.praxisframework.org/en/knowledge/context) and [management](https://www.praxisframework.org/en/knowledge/management).

Contextual  
functions are not directly responsible for achieving project,  
programme or portfolio objectives but are part of the context in which  
supports that endeavour.

Management functions are the ones that are applied in the completion of projects, programmes and portfolios.

A  
key concept of Praxis is that the dividing lines between projects,  
programmes and portfolios are blurred. Some ventures will exhibit  
characteristics of all three. The underlying principle is that the terms  
project, programme and portfolio simply represent points on a  
continuum that is described by the [complexity](https://www.praxisframework.org/en/knowledge/complexity) of the work being managed.

Therefore,  
wherever appropriate, a function is described in terms of its general  
application and then by its adaptation to increasing complexity.

The  
knowledge section integrates with all the other sections of Praxis.  
Each function describes the procedures, tools and techniques that can  
be used in management processes. In return the method section provides a  
structure for the use of the functions within the [life cycle](https://www.praxisframework.org/en/knowledge/life-cycle).

The management functions also provide the structure and  
specific goals for the capability aspect of maturity. The procedures  
described in each function are used as the basis for defining different  
levels of capability and the attributes described in the maturity model  
provide benchmarks for the organisational implementation of the  
function.

The goals and procedures described in  
the functions form the basis of the knowledge and performance criteria  
listed for each competency. In return these provide benchmarks for the  
individual performance of the function.
