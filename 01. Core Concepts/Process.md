# Comprehensive Study Notes: Praxis Process Models

## Introduction to the Process Models

- Praxis provides two distinct process models to guide the management of P3 initiatives:
    
    1. One consolidated model for **projects and programmes**.
    
    2. One separate model for **portfolios**.

## The Unified Project and Programme Process Model

- A key feature of the Praxis Framework is its treatment of projects and programmes. Most other guidance describes separate processes for projects and programmes.

- Praxis takes a different view. Detailed comparison of these separate models demonstrates that they are **fundamentally the same**. Both are temporary endeavours that follow a similar, transient life cycle.

### Rationale for a Unified Model

- The artificial distinction of ‘projects’ and ‘programmes’ as completely different entities can introduce unnecessary **confusion**.

- It also places unhelpful **constraints** on competent managers when they are undertaking initiatives that are, in reality, a **combination of the two** (as they are conventionally defined).

- For example, a large project might have some benefits realisation and change management components, while a small programme might be very focused on a tightly related set of outputs.

### The Praxis Approach: A Continuum of Complexity

- Praxis describes the **general characteristics of each process** and then explains how these can be applied and scaled as **complexity increases**, from simple projects at one end of the spectrum to complex programmes at the other.

- This approach supports the core principle, embraced by Praxis, that describing projects and programmes as two, mutually exclusive types of initiative has more to do with the human desire to categorise than with real, practical differences in how they are managed.

> [IMPORTANT]  
> The Praxis method for projects and programmes is not a "one size fits all" approach. It is a single, scalable framework that is adapted to the context and complexity of the specific work being undertaken.

## The Portfolio Process Model

- Although Praxis defines two types of portfolio (**standard** and **structured**), the process model is the **same for both**.

- The difference between a standard and structured portfolio is not in the fundamental process of management, but in the **scope, objectives, and emphasis** of that management.

- For example, a structured portfolio will place a much heavier emphasis on the strategic alignment and balancing activities within the process model than a standard portfolio would. The underlying process, however, remains consistent.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** How many process models does Praxis provide and what do they cover?
    - **A:** Two. One model covers both projects and programmes, and a separate model covers portfolios.

- **Q:** Why does Praxis use a single process model for both projects and programmes?
    - **A:** Because detailed comparison shows that their management processes are fundamentally the same, and creating an artificial distinction can cause confusion and place unnecessary constraints on managers.

- **Q:** How does the Praxis project/programme model handle the differences between a simple project and a complex programme?
    - **A:** It describes the general characteristics of each process and then explains how the process can be adapted and scaled to handle increasing levels of complexity.

- **Q:** Does Praxis have different process models for standard and structured portfolios?
    - **A:** No, the process model is the same for both. The difference lies in the emphasis and objectives of the management activities within that process.
