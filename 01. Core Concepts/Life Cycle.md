# Comprehensive Study Notes: The P3 Life Cycle

## General Principles of a Life Cycle

- **Definition**: A P3 life cycle illustrates the distinct phases that take an initial idea, capture stakeholder requirements, develop a set of objectives, and then deliver those objectives in a structured manner.

- **Goals of Life Cycle Management**:
    
    - To identify and define the phases of a life cycle that best match the context of the work.
    
    - To structure governance activities and decision-making in accordance with these defined phases.

- **Application to P3**:
    
    - Projects and programmes are the primary mechanisms for _delivering_ objectives, so their life cycles are similar and focus on a progression from idea to delivery.
    
    - Portfolios are more focused on _co-ordinating and governing_ the delivery of multiple projects and programmes, so their life cycle is more cyclical and continuous.

### The Basic Life Cycle Model

- The simplest model is a project life cycle focused on developing a single output. It follows a logical, linear progression:
    
    1. **Idea/Identification**: An idea is deemed worthy of investigation. High-level requirements are gathered to assess viability. This phase ends with a **gate review** to decide whether to invest in more detailed definition.
    
    2. **Definition**: If approved, the idea is defined in detail, producing a full justification (the business case) and detailed plans. This phase ends with a second, major **gate review** to approve the start of the main delivery work.
    
    3. **Delivery**: The output is created according to the plans.
    
    4. **Closure**: The output is formally accepted and handed over to its new owner, and the project is formally closed.

- This basic model can be extended to show the ultimate purpose of the output—realising benefits:  
    5. **Benefits Realisation**: This phase occurs after the output is in use, where the benefits outlined in the business case are measured and achieved.

> [!NOTE]  
> This fundamental structure can be adapted to many different contexts, such as work performed by a contractor, a project within a programme, or work where the scope evolves over time. The complexity of the scope is a major factor influencing the final shape of the life cycle.

## Governance and the Life Cycle

- The phased structure of a life cycle is the backbone upon which governance mechanisms are built. It provides natural points for oversight, review, and decision-making.

- **Key Governance Mechanisms Enabled by a Phased Life Cycle**:
    
    - **Defined Processes**: The management of each phase can be described as a distinct process with specific activities and deliverables.
    
    - **Stages and Tranches**: The main "Delivery" phase can be subdivided into smaller, more manageable packages of work. These are typically called **stages** in projects and **tranches** in programmes.
    
    - **Gate Reviews**: These are formal decision points at the end of a phase, stage, or tranche. The sponsor reviews performance to date and plans for the next period to decide if the business case remains viable, practical, and achievable before authorising further work.
    
    - **Post-Reviews**: Post-project or post-programme reviews are conducted to capture and document lessons learned, which is a key factor in improving organisational capability maturity.
    
    - **Benefit Reviews**: These reviews formally measure the achievement of benefits against the baseline defined in the business case.

## Serial vs. Parallel Life Cycles: The Two Main Approaches

- The fundamental difference between life cycle approaches is whether the requirements and solution can be fully **defined up-front (serial)** or if they must **evolve throughout the work (parallel)**.

- **1. Serial Life Cycle (e.g., Waterfall)**:
    
    - **Description**: Phases are performed in a strict linear sequence. The output of one phase must be completed and approved before the next phase begins.
    
    - **When to Use**: This approach is suitable when the deliverables can be substantially specified and defined before the main delivery work starts.

- **2. Parallel Life Cycle (e.g., Iterative, Agile)**:
    
    - **Description**: Phases overlap. The definition of one part of the work may happen at the same time as the delivery of another part. There are feedback loops between phases.
    
    - **When to Use**: This approach is necessary when the full specification evolves as the work progresses. It can also be used to **"fast track"** a project by running specification and delivery in parallel to reduce the overall duration.

> [!TIP]  
> Parallel life cycles are the foundation for delivery methods such as Agile and concurrent engineering. It's important to distinguish the overall P3 management life cycle from the specific technical development life cycle (e.g., Waterfall, V-Model, Scrum) used to create the product itself.

## The Project Life Cycle

### A Typical Serial Project Life Cycle

1. **Identification**: The initial idea is developed, a project brief is created, and a sponsor is appointed. Enough analysis is done for stakeholders to decide if the project is likely to be viable and if it's worth investing in a full definition.

2. **Definition**: Requirements are assessed in detail, a preferred solution is specified, and the full business case and management plans are created. This must be approved by the sponsor before delivery can begin.

3. **Delivery**: The project's output is created. This phase can be broken down into multiple **stages**, with a gate review at the end of each stage.

4. **Handover and Closure**: The final outputs are formally handed over to and accepted by the client or users. The project is then administratively closed.

5. **Benefits Realisation**: This phase may be included in an "extended" project life cycle, typically where there is a simple, one-to-one relationship between the project's output and the resulting benefit.

### A Parallel (Iterative) Project Life Cycle

- In a parallel life cycle, the phases overlap significantly. A key characteristic is the **feedback loop** between them.

- The experience of delivering an initial increment influences the definition of the next. The experience of handover and early benefits realisation can feed back into prior phases.

- This can be viewed as a single iterative cycle that is repeated as many times as necessary to deliver the full scope, after which the project is closed. This is the core concept behind Agile methods.

## The Programme Life Cycle

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Programme life cycles are inherently parallel. While a detailed definition is done upfront to authorize the programme, further detailed definition occurs within each project. Benefits realisation begins as soon as the first project delivers an output and runs in parallel with the rest of the delivery work.

### A Typical Programme Life Cycle

1. **Identification**: The programme's **vision** and an outline business case are created. A sponsor is appointed, and expected benefits are outlined. The goal is to decide if the programme is likely to be viable and worth investing in a full definition.

2. **Definition**: The vision is developed into a detailed description of the programme's end state, often called a **blueprint**. The full business case and all management plans are developed for final approval.

3. **Delivery**: This phase is broken down into groups of projects called **tranches**. Each tranche is designed to deliver a coherent set of outputs that enable a significant step-change in beneficial capability. A major review at the end of each tranche assesses the continuing justification for the entire programme.

4. **Benefits Realisation**: As projects deliver outputs, transformation work must be done to embed these outputs into business-as-usual and change ways of working. Benefits are then measured against the business case. This phase is not a single block but fluctuates in intensity throughout the programme's life.

5. **Closure**: The final projects are closed, budgets are reconciled, and the programme management team and infrastructure are demobilised.

> [!NOTE]  
> The realisation of benefits will almost always continue long after the programme itself has formally closed. The sponsor and Business Change Managers typically remain in their roles to ensure the full value promised in the business case is achieved.

## The Portfolio Life Cycle

- Unlike projects and programmes, portfolios rarely have a defined start and finish. Portfolio management is a **continuous, cyclical activity** that co-ordinates the delivery of projects and programmes to meet strategic objectives.

- The cycle may, however, be constrained by the organisation's strategic planning cycle (e.g., a 3-year or 5-year cycle).

### The Portfolio Management Cycle

- **Initiation (One-off Phase)**: This represents the point at which the organisation decides to establish a formal portfolio and creates the necessary infrastructure and governance to enable the cycle to operate.

- **The Continuous Cycle**: At any given time, aspects of all the following phases will be undertaken simultaneously.
    
    1. **Definition**: The projects, programmes, and business change initiatives required to meet strategic objectives are identified and evaluated.
    
    2. **Categorisation**: The identified initiatives may be grouped into sub-portfolios based on shared characteristics, such as alignment with a specific strategic goal.
    
    3. **Prioritisation**: Based on metrics like strategic value or return on investment, initiatives are prioritised to determine where to focus limited resources.
    
    4. **Balancing**: The portfolio is then reviewed and adjusted to ensure it is balanced in terms of risk, resource usage, cash flow, and the cumulative impact of change across the business.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is the primary purpose of a gate review in a life cycle?
    - **A:** To provide a formal decision point for the sponsor to review progress and decide if the business case remains viable before authorising investment in the next phase, stage, or tranche.

- **Q:** What is the fundamental difference between a serial and a parallel life cycle?
    - **A:** A **serial** life cycle requires full definition upfront before delivery begins (linear). A **parallel** life cycle allows definition and delivery to overlap and evolve throughout the work (iterative).

- **Q:** What is a "tranche" and in which type of life cycle is it found?
    - **A:** A tranche is a group of related projects within a programme, designed to deliver a significant step-change in beneficial capability. It is found in a **programme life cycle**.

- **Q:** Why is a portfolio life cycle considered a "cycle" rather than a linear process?
    - **A:** Because portfolio management is a continuous activity of defining, prioritising, and balancing a collection of projects and programmes to align with ongoing strategic objectives, rather than a temporary endeavour with a defined start and end.
