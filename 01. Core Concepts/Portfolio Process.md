# Portfolio Process

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Portfolio Processes

## Introduction to the Portfolio Process Model

- While the process models for projects and programmes are very similar, the **portfolio process model is quite different** and, at first glance, appears to be much simpler.

- This difference is driven by the fundamentally different nature and life cycle of a portfolio compared to a project or programme.

### The Varied Nature of Portfolios

- Portfolios are very varied in their nature, scale, and complexity.

- **Small Standard Portfolio**: A small contracting organisation may have a standard portfolio of a few projects. The primary reasons for managing these as a portfolio are to **co-ordinate resources** and **embed good practice** consistently across all projects. This is sometimes known simply as the "management of projects."

- **Large Structured Portfolio**: At the other end of the scale, a large multinational organisation may have a structured portfolio of projects and programmes designed to meet the **strategic objectives** of a five-year business planning cycle.

> [IMPORTANT]  
> The portfolio process model shown in the Praxis Framework is common to all types of portfolio. The differences in scale and complexity are addressed by how the process is applied and tailored, not by using a different process.

## The Praxis Portfolio Process Model

- The portfolio process model is more cyclical than the linear life cycle of projects and programmes. It consists of two main overarching processes.

### 1. Portfolio Governance Process

- **Analogy**: This process is analogous to the **Sponsorship Process** in the project/programme model.

- **Purpose**: It represents the interface between the portfolio management team and the senior executive leadership or board of the host organisation.

- **Activities**: It covers the activities needed to provide senior management with the confidence that the portfolio is being managed effectively. This includes high-level oversight, strategic decision-making, and ensuring the portfolio remains aligned with the organisation's goals.

### 2. Portfolio Management Process

- **Analogy**: This is a consolidated process that encompasses activities analogous to the **Identification, Definition, Control, and Closure** processes in the project/programme model.

- **Purpose**: This is the core engine of portfolio management, covering the day-to-day and cyclical activities of managing the collection of projects and programmes.

- **Activities**: It is a continuous cycle of activities that includes:
    
    - **Identifying and Defining** potential new projects and programmes for inclusion in the portfolio.
    
    - **Prioritising** the component projects and programmes based on strategic criteria.
    
    - **Balancing** the portfolio to ensure it is achievable in terms of risk, resource capacity, and financial constraints.
    
    - **Co-ordinating** the delivery of the component projects and programmes.
    
    - **Closing** down projects and programmes as they complete or are no longer required.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** How does the portfolio process model differ from the project/programme model?
    - **A:** The portfolio model is more cyclical and continuous, reflecting its ongoing nature, whereas the project/programme model is more linear, reflecting a transient life cycle with a defined start and end.

- **Q:** Name the two main processes in the Praxis portfolio process model.
    - **A:** The Portfolio Governance Process and the Portfolio Management Process.

- **Q:** Which project/programme process is the Portfolio Governance Process analogous to?
    - **A:** The Sponsorship Process.

- **Q:** Does Praxis use different process models for standard and structured portfolios?
    - **A:** No, the process model is the same for both. The differences in portfolio type are addressed by how the process is applied and tailored.

- **Q:** What is the primary purpose of a small, standard portfolio, often called the "management of projects"?
    - **A:** To co-ordinate resources efficiently and embed good management practice consistently across all projects.
