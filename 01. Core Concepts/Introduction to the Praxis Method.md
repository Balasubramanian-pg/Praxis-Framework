# Overview

# Comprehensive Study Notes: The Praxis Method Overview

## Introduction to the Praxis Method

- The **Praxis Method** is a core component of the Praxis Framework, sitting at the heart of the governance of any project, programme, or portfolio.

- It comprises two key elements:
    
    - **Process Models**: Structured sets of activities that guide the management of the work through its life cycle.
    
    - **Documentation Descriptions**: Templates and guidance for the key documents used in P3 management.

- The individual processes within the method make practical use of the functional procedures, tools, and techniques described elsewhere in the Praxis Framework.

- The method provides a **life cycle-based approach** to applying these functions and tools in a structured and consistent way.

## The Two Process Models

- Praxis includes two distinct process models to reflect the different life cycles of P3 initiatives.

### 1. The Project and Programme Process Model

- The nature of **projects and programmes** means that they have very similar, transient life cycles (a defined start and end).

- They can therefore be managed using the **same fundamental set of processes**.

- These processes are simply **adapted** to suit the specific context of the work, and particularly its level of **complexity**.

### 2. The Portfolio Process Model

- While **portfolios** share many characteristics with programmes, they have a **different, more cyclical and continuous life cycle**.

- Portfolios are often semi-permanent or permanent structures aligned with ongoing strategic objectives.

- For this reason, Praxis provides a separate and distinct process model specifically for the management of portfolios.

## The Method as an Integration Hub

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The processes and documentation in the method provide the central mechanism for the integration of the other main sections of the Praxis Framework (Knowledge, Competence, and Capability Maturity).

- The diagram illustrates how the Method acts as the central hub, connecting the individual **Functions** (from the Knowledge section) with the desired outcomes of **Competence** and **Capability Maturity**.

### Relationship with Capability Maturity

- The adaptation and implementation of consistent methods is a critical factor in developing an organisation's **capability maturity**.

- The method's processes are the mechanism that integrates individual **functions** (which are assessed for _capability_) into a coherent life cycle, allowing the organisation to achieve overall _maturity_.

- This is a **two-way relationship**:
    
    - The goals and activities of each process provide the basis for defining the **indicators used to measure maturity**.
    
    - In return, the maturity model provides attributes and guidance that can be used to direct the **implementation and tailoring of the method**.

### Relationship with Competence

- The goals and process activities described in the method provide the structure for defining the **knowledge and performance criteria** in the competency framework. They define what a competent person needs to know and do to execute the method effectively.

- This is also a **two-way relationship**:
    - In return, the competency definitions provide a **benchmark** for assessing an individual's performance of the processes described in the method.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the two main components of the Praxis Method?
    - **A:** Process models and descriptions of documentation.

- **Q:** Why does Praxis have two separate process models?
    - **A:** Because projects and programmes have similar, transient life cycles and can use one model, while portfolios have a different, more cyclical life cycle that requires a separate model.

- **Q:** What is the primary role of the Method in relation to the other sections of the Praxis Framework?
    - **A:** It acts as the central integration hub. The processes in the method provide the mechanism for integrating individual functions to achieve organisational capability maturity and define the criteria for individual competence.

- **Q:** How does the Method relate to Capability Maturity?
    - **A:** The method's processes integrate individual functional capabilities to achieve overall organisational maturity. The process goals define the indicators for measuring maturity.

- **Q:** How does the Method relate to Competence?
    - **A:** The method's process goals and activities provide the structure for the knowledge and performance criteria that define what a competent person needs to do.
