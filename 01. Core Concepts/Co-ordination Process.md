# Co-ordination process

Coordination in the **Praxis Framework** is about enabling teams, suppliers, and stakeholders to move in a unified direction. It is practical, human-centered, and outcome-driven. In the words of a leadership mindset: we empower people to align purpose with delivery. And we build clarity so execution becomes a shared responsibility.

## What Coordination Means

* A continuous management activity
* Ensures project, program, portfolio elements act in concert
* Avoids duplication of effort, ambiguity, and operational silos
* Drives timely decision-making and transparent communication

> **info**
> Coordination is woven into every Praxis function. It is not a separate role; it is a collective discipline.

## Core Intent

* Enhance alignment on objectives, priorities, and expectations
* Strengthen integration across governance, delivery, and assurance
* Build trust and accountability across all contributors
* Enable agility and adaptability when change occurs

## Where Coordination Operates

* Across **lifecycle phases** from concept to closure
* Between **delivery functions** such as scope, risk, schedule, finance
* Within **governance structures** such as sponsorship and steering groups
* Among **stakeholders** including customers, suppliers, communities

## Pillars of Effective Coordination

* **Clarity** of roles, interfaces, responsibilities
* **Visibility** of information and performance indicators
* **Cadence** of communication and collaboration rituals
* **Consistency** in applying methods, standards, and controls
* **Integration** of decisions and dependencies

> **note**
> Praxis treats coordination as a bridge between people, systems, and delivery practices.

## Key Activities in Praxis Coordination

* Aligning strategic objectives with delivery decisions
* Managing interdependencies and handoffs
* Resolving conflicts in priorities, resources, or timelines
* Ensuring information flows to the right people at the right moment
* Maintaining coherence between plans and realities on the ground
* Supporting continuous review and adjustment

## Collaboration and Stakeholder Engagement

* Facilitate participation in planning and decision forums
* Maintain stakeholder commitment throughout change
* Surface concerns early and ensure feedback loops are active

> **tip**
> Build a culture where coordination feels like empowerment, not policing.

## Tools and Enablers

* Integrated governance and reporting dashboards
* Dependency mapping and interface management methods
* Structured communications such as stand-ups, checkpoints, reviews
* Common language for status, risk, and performance

## Success Measures

* Reduced friction in delivery processes
* Increased predictability of outcomes
* Faster resolution of dependencies and blockers
* Stronger confidence across stakeholder groups

## Leadership Mindset (channeling Satya Nadella)

* Lead with empathy and transparency
* Encourage partnership over hierarchy
* Amplify every individual’s impact by connecting their work to the shared mission
* Elevate innovation by making coordination a catalyst rather than a constraint

## Closing Thought

When coordination is done well, teams don’t feel controlled; they feel empowered. They understand how their work contributes to something larger. And the organization gains velocity with purpose.
