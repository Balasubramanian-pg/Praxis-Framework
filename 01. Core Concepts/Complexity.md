# Comprehensive Study Notes: Complexity in P3 Management

## Introduction to Complexity

- **Definition**: Complexity is an indicator of the quantity and nature of the inter-relationships within a project, programme, or portfolio. These relationships directly affect the way the work must be managed and the skills required of the management team.

- By its dictionary definition, all P3 work is complex because it is composed of many inter-related functions, processes, and components.

- In P3 management, the term is used relatively. The key is not to ask "is it complex?" but rather "to what degree is it complex?".

- There is a general recognition that different degrees of complexity require different managerial approaches, skills, and governance structures.

> [!NOTE]  
> Complexity is largely subjective and "in the eye of the beholder." What one experienced manager finds straightforward, another might find highly complex. There is no absolute, universal scale for measuring it.

## Complexity as a Spectrum

- Praxis and modern P3 management view complexity not as a binary state (i.e., complex vs. non-complex) but as a **continuous scale**.

- Different aspects of P3 management will exhibit different degrees of complexity.

- This perspective is crucial because the degree of complexity in various areas directly influences how management functions, methods, and competencies must be **tailored** to fit the specific circumstances of the work.

- **Application across P3**:
    
    - **Projects and Programmes**: Both can exhibit varying degrees of complexity across multiple dimensions.
    
    - **Portfolios**: Have an inherent level of complexity simply due to their scale and the number of components. However, their overall complexity is mainly a reflection of the cumulative complexity of the projects and programmes they contain.

## Commonly Identified Areas of Complexity

### 1. Scope

- **Definition**: Scope is arguably the most obvious and influential area of complexity. It describes the boundaries and content of the work to be done.

- **The Scope Spectrum**:
    
    - **Low Complexity**: The production of a single, well-defined output (e.g., building a standard garden shed).
    
    - **High Complexity**: The delivery of a complex combination of inter-related outputs, outcomes, and benefits (e.g., merging the IT systems of two acquired companies while managing the associated business change).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Complexity of scope should not be confused with scale (cost or duration). A large-scale project can be relatively simple in scope, while a small-scale initiative can be incredibly complex.
> 
> - **Example**: The construction of a major highway is a large-scale project that may take years and cost billions, but its scope can be less complex (linear, understood processes) than a much smaller, shorter project aimed at transforming an organisation's culture, which involves intricate social, technological, and procedural changes.

- **Influence on Management**: The complexity of the scope is the single most influential factor in choosing the appropriate life cycle and management method.
    - The decision of whether to manage work as a **project** or a **programme** is primarily based on the complexity of its scope.

### 2. Uncertainty

- **Definition**: All projects and programmes are, by their very nature, uncertain. They are unique endeavours with unknown elements. P3 management is fundamentally designed to manage this uncertainty.

- **Managing vs. Removing Uncertainty**:
    
    - A common misconception is that the goal is to remove all uncertainty before work begins. This is not the case. If complete certainty were a prerequisite, very few innovative or challenging endeavours would ever be undertaken.
    
    - Effective P3 management **embraces uncertainty** but ensures that the methods, techniques, and resources used are appropriate for the level of uncertainty inherent in the work.

- **Sources of Uncertainty**:
    
    - Initial assumptions proving incorrect.
    
    - The predictability (or unpredictability) of outcomes.
    
    - The stability of specifications and requirements.
    
    - External market or political changes.
    
    - Availability and performance of resources.

- **Management Response**:
    - One key strategy for managing high uncertainty in scope is to use a **parallel or iterative life cycle** (e.g., Agile) rather than a linear one (e.g., Waterfall). This allows objectives to evolve and be refined throughout the work.

### 3. Change

- **Definition**: This refers to the degree to which individuals and groups are required to change the way they live or work, either permanently or for the duration of the initiative. Some simple projects may involve no organisational or social change at all.

- Change complexity can be viewed along two dimensions: **breadth** and **depth**.

- **Breadth of Change**:
    
    - Relates to the **number and range of people** who will be affected by the change.
    
    - The broader the change, the larger and more diverse the stakeholder community becomes.
    
    - This increases the complexity of managing communications, expectations, support, and opposition.
    
    - **Range**: From a small team in a single department to a vast international community spanning multiple organisations and cultures.

- **Depth of Change**:
    - Refers to the **degree or impact** of the change on those affected. It is about how significantly people have to alter their behaviours, skills, or circumstances.

> [!WARNING]  
> Deep change can have profound personal consequences and must be managed with extreme care and empathy. Examples of deep change include:
> 
> - Business transformation that leads to significant job losses.
> 
> - An infrastructure project (like a new railway) that requires displacing people from their homes.

### 4. Innovation

- **Definition**: Innovation complexity arises from the introduction of newness or unfamiliarity. It can be viewed in two main forms: technical and managerial.

- **Technical Innovation**:
    
    - This is the more obvious form, driven by the rapid pace of technological advancement.
    
    - It includes projects and programmes that either **create new technology** or are the **first to implement** new technology in a practical setting.

- **Managerial Innovation**:
    
    - This relates to the use of management methods that are new _to the organisation_.
    
    - Innovation is a **relative term**. What is standard practice in one organisation may be highly innovative and therefore complex for another.
    
    - **Example**: An organisation with a high level of maturity in delivering stand-alone projects may have never delivered a true programme before. For this organisation, adopting a programme management approach is an innovative act, introducing a new layer of complexity related to benefits management, stakeholder engagement, and project coordination.

### 5. Dynamics

- **Definition**: The degree of complexity in a project or programme is not static; it is subject to change. The web of inter-relationships will vary over the life cycle.

- **Environmental Stability**:
    
    - Some work operates in a relatively stable and predictable environment.
    
    - Other work is subject to constant external change, whether it be **political**, **social**, **technical**, or **economic**.

- **Impact on Management**: A dynamic and unstable environment dramatically increases complexity because the management team must constantly reassess plans, risks, and assumptions to adapt to the changing context.

## The Challenge of Modeling Complexity

- Any attempt to create a single, definitive, universal model for categorising complexity is likely a pointless exercise. The concept of complexity is, itself, too complex and multifaceted.

- Different sources and frameworks list different areas of complexity, and no single model is universally accepted.

> [!TIP]  
> Where complexity models can be highly effective is within a closed environment. An organisation can develop its own tailored complexity model based on its specific range of work. Such a model can be a powerful tool for:
> 
> - Matching projects with suitably experienced project or programme managers.
> 
> - Determining the appropriate level of investment in governance and support infrastructure (like a PMO).
> 
> - Standardising risk assessment at the portfolio level.

## The Ultimate Purpose of Understanding Complexity

- The goal of analyzing complexity is not to label work with a score or fit it into a neat box.

- The point is to understand the incredible **diversity of work** that can be tackled with P3 management.

- This understanding leads to the most critical principle for success: the vital need to **tailor all aspects of the discipline**—governance, functions, methods, competencies, and tools—to the specific circumstances of each project, programme, or portfolio.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is complexity in the context of P3 management?
    - **A:** It is an indicator of the inter-relationships within a project, programme, or portfolio that affects how it should be managed and the skills needed to manage it.

- **Q:** What is the difference between scale and scope complexity?
    - **A:** **Scale** refers to size, cost, or duration. **Scope complexity** refers to the intricacy and inter-relationship of the outputs, outcomes, and benefits. A large-scale project can have a simple scope, and vice-versa.

- **Q:** What is the primary factor that determines whether work is managed as a project or a programme?
    - **A:** The complexity of the scope.

- **Q:** How should a P3 manager approach uncertainty?
    - **A:** The goal is not to eliminate uncertainty but to embrace and manage it by tailoring methods, resources, and life cycles (e.g., using an iterative approach) to the level of uncertainty present.

- **Q:** What are the two dimensions of "change complexity"?
    - **A:** **Breadth** (the number of people affected) and **Depth** (the significance of the impact on those people).

- **Q:** Why is innovation considered a "relative" source of complexity?
    - **A:** Because what is innovative and complex for one organisation (e.g., its first-ever programme) might be standard practice and therefore less complex for another.

- **Q:** Why is creating a universal complexity model a "pointless exercise"?

    - **A:** Because complexity itself is too complex, subjective, and context-dependent. However, organisation-specific models can be very useful for decision-making.
