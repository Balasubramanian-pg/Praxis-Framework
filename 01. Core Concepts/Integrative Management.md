# Integrative Management

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Integrative Management

## Introduction to Integrative Management

- **Definition**: The functions in this section are not the fundamental components of delivery (scope, schedule, cost, risk, change, and resource). Instead, they are **integrative functions** that act _across_ those components to weave them into a coherent, controlled, and justified whole.

- Their role is to provide the overarching framework for planning, justification, control, and communication that ensures all the fundamental delivery components work together effectively.

### The Overall Goals of Integrative Management

- The goals of the integrative management functions are to:
    
    - Plan all aspects of the work.
    
    - Develop and maintain the justification for the work.
    
    - Monitor and control performance.
    
    - Ensure information is accurate, current, and accessible.
    
    - Establish and maintain a management team.
    
    - Identify and communicate with people affected by the work.
    
    - Ensure that the management of the work is relevant and effective.

## The Integrative Management Functions

> [!NOTE]  
> Each integrative function brings together aspects of the fundamental delivery components. For example, the planning function integrates by creating a scope management plan, a schedule management plan, a finance management plan, and so on, uniting them under a single governance structure.

### 1. Planning

- **Definition**: The planning function has two primary purposes:
    
    1. It sets out the **policies and procedures** for managing each of the fundamental components (the "how to manage").
    
    2. It **defines and estimates** what needs to be done, how it should be done, and when it should be done (the "what, how, and when").

- **Integration**: Every one of the six fundamental delivery procedures has an explicit "plan" step. The integrative planning function brings these individual plans together. Re-planning is an implicit and continuous activity throughout the life cycle.

### 2. Control

- **Definition**: Control is the counterpart to planning. It takes the outputs of the planning function (the baseline plans) and tracks what actually happens against what was planned to happen.

- **Integration**: Control methods are normally focused on identifying and dealing with deviations from the plan (in scope, schedule, cost, etc.) and attempting to return to the baseline. However, control also involves the critical role of assessing whether to terminate work that is no longer justifiable, based on information from all delivery functions. Control is an implicit part of the specific steps of each delivery procedure.

### 3. Information Management

- **Definition**: The planning and control functions create and consume a large amount of information covering the content and governance of the work. Information management ensures this information is formally created, updated, stored, and communicated effectively.

- **Integration**: This function ensures that accurate and current information from all delivery areas (e.g., risk status, cost reports, schedule progress) is accessible to the right people at the right time to enable effective planning and control.

### 4. Business Case

- **Definition**: The business case is the key document for any project or programme. It states why the work is worth the investment and provides the primary justification for its continuation.

- **Integration**: The business case is perhaps the ultimate integrative document. Preparing and maintaining it requires the summarisation and integration of information from **all the fundamental components**:
    
    - The **scope** defines the objectives.
    
    - The **schedule** and **resources** define the timeline and effort.
    
    - The **finance** function provides the cost estimates.
    
    - The **risk** function qualifies the uncertainty.
    
    - The **change** function defines the benefits to be realised.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The business case weaves together all aspects of delivery into a single, coherent argument for investment. It is the central reference point for all major decisions.

### 5. Organisation Management

- **Definition**: This function describes the structure of the management team itself, including its roles and responsibilities.

- **Integration**: It defines how the various management roles will interact and who is responsible for each of the fundamental and integrative functions, thereby creating the human infrastructure needed to deliver the work.

### 6. Stakeholder Management

- **Definition**: This function explains how people who are involved in, or affected by, the work in any way must be identified and engaged.

- **Integration**: It integrates the human aspect of P3 management. It considers the needs and impacts of the work's scope, schedule, cost, risks, and changes on all stakeholders and plans the communications and engagement needed to maintain their support.

> [!NOTE]  
> Organisation management deals with the internal management team. Stakeholder management deals with all people affected by the work, both internal and external.

### 7. Assurance

- **Definition**: As part of the sponsorship role, a sponsor must ensure that the work is being managed according to the policies and procedures set out when the work was approved. This is achieved through assurance.

- **Integration**: Assurance is an independent review that cuts across all functions. It checks whether the plans are being followed, if control is effective, if risks are being managed, and if the business case remains valid, providing the sponsor with confidence that the work is being managed effectively and remains on track.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is the primary role of an integrative management function?
    - **A:** To act across the six fundamental delivery components (scope, schedule, cost, risk, change, resource) to weave them into a coherent and controlled whole.

- **Q:** What are the two main purposes of the planning function?
    - **A:** 1. To set out the policies for managing the fundamental components, and 2. To define and estimate what needs to be done, how, and when.

- **Q:** What is the relationship between planning and control?
    - **A:** Control is the counterpart to planning. It takes the plans as a baseline and tracks actual performance against them, managing any deviations.

- **Q:** What is the key document that integrates information from all the fundamental components to justify the work?
    - **A:** The business case.

- **Q:** What is the difference between organisation management and stakeholder management?
    - **A:** **Organisation management** defines the internal management team and its roles. **Stakeholder management** deals with all people (internal and external) who are involved in or affected by the work.

- **Q:** What is assurance and who is responsible for it?
    - **A:** Assurance is the independent review that ensures the work is being managed according to its approved policies and procedures. The sponsor is responsible for overseeing assurance.
