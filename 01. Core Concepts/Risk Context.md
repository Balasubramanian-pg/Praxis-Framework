# Comprehensive Study Notes: Risk Context

## General Principles of Risk Context

- **Definition**: Risk context addresses the individual and group attitudes and behaviours that affect the way risk arises and how it is perceived and managed.

- The context can be viewed as having two primary components: **risk attitude** and **risk appetite**.

---

## 1. Risk Attitude

- **Definition**: Risk attitude describes an individual or group’s natural, inherent reaction to uncertainty of any type.

- This reaction is dependent upon their **perception of risk**, which in turn is influenced by a range of factors at both the conscious and unconscious level (e.g., past experiences, personality, culture).

- The effect of risk attitude is most evident during the **response planning step** in the risk management procedure, as it will heavily influence the way people think a risk should be addressed.

### The Spectrum of Risk Attitudes

- Attitudes can be classified in three main ways:
    
    1. **Risk Averse**:
        
        - As the name suggests, risk-averse people dislike taking risks. They prefer certainty and will often choose a lower but more certain reward over a higher but more uncertain one.
        
        - **Positive Application**: When planning work that is risky in a health and safety context (e.g., construction) or when working in a war zone, being risk-averse is an advantage. It means the planner will adopt a very cautious approach to planning risk responses.
        
        - **Negative Application**: If a project is developing products for an entrepreneurial tech company in a fast-moving, competitive market, being risk-averse is unlikely to help and could lead to missed opportunities.
    
    2. **Risk Seeking**:
        
        - Risk-seeking people are comfortable with uncertainty and are often willing to take on higher levels of risk in the pursuit of higher rewards.
        
        - This attitude is more appropriate for the entrepreneurial tech company mentioned above.
    
    3. **Risk Neutral**:
        
        - Risk-neutral people are balanced in their approach. They make decisions based on expected value, without a strong bias towards or against risk.
        
        - Perhaps this is the best personal attribute for a P3 manager, as it may be easier for them to consciously move towards aversion or seeking as the specific context of the work demands.

### The Impact of Risk Attitude on Risk Assessment

- Risk attitude can have a major impact on the **assessment step** of the risk procedure, particularly when qualitative techniques are being used.

- Someone who is naturally risk-averse may estimate the probability and impact of a threat as being higher than someone who is naturally risk-seeking.

- Where major risks need to be assessed accurately, techniques such as the **Delphi method** can help to reconcile the different risk attitudes of the individuals involved and reach a more objective consensus.

## 2. Risk Appetite

- **Definition**: Risk appetite represents the **amount of risk** that an individual or organisation is **prepared to take** in order to achieve their objectives.

- It is a more conscious and strategic concept than risk attitude.

- Risk appetite is most evident in the **identification step** of the risk procedure, as it sets the threshold for what is considered an acceptable level of risk to take on.

> [IMPORTANT]  
> The Difference Between Attitude and Appetite  
> An organisation's attitude might be generally risk-averse (preferring certainty), but its appetite for a specific, high-priority project might be high (willing to accept significant risk to achieve a strategic goal).
> 
> - **Example**: A charity that delivers aid to a war zone must have a **high risk appetite** to even undertake the work. However, its on-the-ground planners will need to have a **risk-averse attitude** to ensure the safety of their teams. Both must reflect the prevailing context of the work.

- A P3 manager needs to understand the host organisation’s risk appetite as it applies to their work, as well as the different risk attitudes of the team members and stakeholders.

- During the definition process, functions like solutions development will be heavily influenced by the stakeholders’ risk appetite. A high-risk, high-return solution would be acceptable to risk-seeking stakeholders but not to those who are risk-averse.

## Risk Context in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Projects

- A very obvious difference between small projects and large portfolios is the number of people involved. A project is very dependent on the specific attitudes of its **manager and sponsor**.

- Therefore, the manager and sponsor of a project must be very self-aware and consciously control their natural instincts to ensure their risk attitude matches the needs of the project.

- **Client-Contractor Context**: Where a project is being delivered by a contractor for a client, there may be different risk appetites. The contractor may be risk-averse to protect their profit margin, whereas the client may be risk-seeking if there are opportunities to increase the value of the project’s output. This can lead to an ethical dimension, where a project manager must balance the interests of their own company (the contractor) with the interests of the client.

### Programmes and Portfolios

- At the complex end of the spectrum, the management team must work to manage the myriad different risk attitudes of a large and diverse group of stakeholders to match the needs of the programme or portfolio.

- Programme and portfolio management teams must ensure that the acceptable level of risk for the work _as a whole_ is reflected in the risk management of the individual component projects and programmes.

- This **does not** mean that every project or programme will need to have the same risk appetite.

- Instead, the projects and programmes must be categorised, prioritised, and **balanced** with the overall acceptable level of risk for the portfolio in mind. A portfolio might deliberately contain a mix of low-risk and high-risk initiatives to achieve a balanced risk profile.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the two main components of the risk context?
    - **A:** Risk attitude and risk appetite.

- **Q:** What is the difference between risk attitude and risk appetite?
    - **A:** **Risk attitude** is an individual or group’s natural, inherent reaction to uncertainty. **Risk appetite** is the amount of risk an organisation is consciously prepared to take to achieve its objectives.

- **Q:** Name the three classifications of risk attitude.
    - **A:** Risk averse, risk neutral, and risk seeking.

- **Q:** How can differing risk attitudes negatively impact the risk assessment step?
    - **A:** A risk-averse person may assess the probability and impact of a threat as higher than a risk-seeking person, leading to inconsistent and subjective assessments.

- **Q:** Does every project in a portfolio need to have the same risk appetite as the overall portfolio?
    - **A:** No. The portfolio must be balanced with the overall risk appetite in mind, but it can contain a mix of high-risk and low-risk projects to achieve this balance.
