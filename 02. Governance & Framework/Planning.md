# Comprehensive Study Notes: Planning

## General Principles of Planning

- **Definition**: Planning is the fundamental management function that determines **what** is to be delivered, **how much** it will cost, **when** it will be delivered, **how** it will be delivered, **who** will carry it out, and how all this will be **managed**.

- Planning occurs broadly at two distinct levels: **governance** and **delivery**.

## 1. Governance Level Planning (Management Plans)

- At the governance level, a series of **management plans** sets out the principles of _how_ each aspect of the work will be managed. These are the "rulebooks" for the P3 initiative.

### The Goals of Management Plans

- The goals of these governance-level management plans are to:
    
    1. Describe the principles, policies, and procedures that should be used to manage the work.
    
    2. Provide consistency (by setting standards) with flexibility (by allowing tailoring) across multiple projects and programmes.

- **Examples**: These plans include documents such as the risk management plan, scope management plan, financial management plan, and stakeholder management plan.

- **Content**: They list preferred techniques, provide templates for documentation, and define key roles and responsibilities for that function.

- **Quality Planning**: Because these plans ensure the quality of the P3 management processes and their deliverables, developing the governance-level plans could also be termed **‘quality planning’**.

## 2. Delivery Level Planning (Delivery Plans)

- Delivery plans are the documents that describe the actual work to be done. They address seven fundamental questions.

### The Goals of Delivery Planning

- The goals of delivery planning are to:
    
    1. Describe the objectives of the project, programme, or portfolio.
    
    2. Define the work required to achieve the objectives and describe how it will be performed.
    
    3. Estimate the resources and finance needed to perform the work.
    
    4. Document these plans and ensure they are updated throughout the life cycle.

### The Seven Questions of Delivery Planning

1. **Why?** Everyone involved must understand why the work is being done. This is answered at a high level by the **vision** and in detail by the **business case**.

2. **What?** The objectives of the work, determined through requirements management. These are described as outputs, outcomes, and/or benefits in documents like a **specification**, **blueprint**, or **benefit profile**.

3. **How?** The chosen approach for achieving the objectives, determined through solutions development.

4. **Who?** The management organisation and the delivery resources required to perform the work.

5. **When?** The timing of milestones, stages, tranches, work packages, and activities, as determined by **schedule management**.

6. **Where?** The physical or virtual location of the work, which is especially important for complex, geographically distributed initiatives.

7. **How much?** The cost of the work and how it will be funded, as determined by **financial management**.

## Planning in the Life Cycle

- The P3 life cycle is designed to answer these seven questions in progressive stages.
    
    - **Identification Process**: Outline documentation is developed to answer the questions at a high level.
    
    - **Definition Process**: Subject to approval, detailed delivery plans are produced to answer the questions in much greater detail.

- Once agreed upon at the end of the definition process, the delivery plans provide the **baselines** against which performance will be measured.

### The Estimating Funnel

- All delivery plans originate from **estimates**. In the early phases of a project or programme, there is less information available, so estimates have a wide range of uncertainty. As the work progresses and more information becomes available, the range of estimates narrows.

- This is known as the **estimating funnel**.

> [!WARNING]  
> This inherent uncertainty in early plans is often ignored or misunderstood by key stakeholders, who may interpret estimates as firm commitments. It is crucial for the P3 manager to communicate this uncertainty and use techniques like Monte Carlo analysis (for schedules) and the use of contingency reserves (for budgets) to manage and provide evidence of the effects of the estimating funnel.

### Ownership and Development of Plans

- The **P3 manager owns** the management and delivery plans.

- However, the plans should be developed in collaboration with the wider team to remove ambiguity, set realistic expectations, and develop commitment.

- Specialist planning expertise (e.g., schedulers, cost engineers) may be provided by a support function.

## Planning in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Small Projects

- Small projects rarely have the resources to invest in developing a full suite of bespoke management plans. Good management practices will depend heavily on the skill and experience of the project manager.

- In a more mature organisation, standard management plans may be available that the project manager can tailor to suit the smaller scale of their project.

- **Too much planning can be as damaging as too little.** All planning documents must be tailored to the context of the work. A simple stakeholder map or risk register is far better than none at all, but time spent making them overly complicated can be a distraction from the actual work.

### Programmes and Large Projects

- It is unreasonable and impractical to develop detailed delivery plans for the entire life cycle of a large project or programme.

- It is common to apply the principle of **rolling wave planning**, where earlier stages and tranches are planned in significant detail, while later ones are planned at a higher level and only detailed as they draw closer.

- Programmes and portfolios will have central, high-level plans and delegated, more detailed delivery plans.
    
    - **Example**: A programme may have a high-level schedule showing each project as a single bar on a Gantt chart. Each of those projects will then have its own detailed schedule.
    
    - The challenge for planners is to enable information to flow effectively between the higher and lower levels of the plan while preserving the planning autonomy of the individual project managers.

### Parent Body Guidance

- Where a project is part of a programme or portfolio, the parent body (the programme or portfolio team) should provide the standard management plans and guidance on how delivery plans should be produced to ensure consistency.

- An exception is a standard portfolio of contracted projects for different clients, where each client may specify their own standard approaches. In this case, the portfolio management team must concentrate on supporting the project teams in their use of these varied standards.

## Flashcard Q-&A

- **Q:** What are the two main levels of planning?
    - **A:** Governance level planning (management plans) and Delivery level planning (delivery plans).

- **Q:** What is the main purpose of a management plan (governance level)?
    - **A:** To describe the principles, policies, and procedures of _how_ a particular aspect of the work (e.g., risk, scope) will be managed.

- **Q:** What is the "estimating funnel"?
    - **A:** The concept that in the early phases of a project, estimates have a wide range of uncertainty, which narrows as the project progresses and more information becomes available.

- **Q:** What is "rolling wave planning"?
    - **A:** A technique used on large projects and programmes where earlier phases are planned in detail, while later phases are planned at a higher level until they get closer.

- **Q:** Who owns the management and delivery plans?

    - **A:** The P3 Manager.
