# Governance

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Governance in P3 Management

## General Principles of Governance

- **Origin**: The word 'governance' originates from the practice of a government governing a political state. In recent years, the concept has been adapted into the commercial world as **corporate governance**.

- **P3 Governance**: This is the application of the principles of corporate governance to the management of projects, programmes, and portfolios. While definitions vary, they all share key elements.

### The Goals of P3 Governance

- The primary goals of a P3 governance framework are to:
    
    - Provide a system of **good practice** by which projects, programmes, and portfolios will be managed.
    
    - Balance the differing and often competing needs of all **stakeholders**.
    
    - Monitor the actions of the management team to mitigate the risk of inappropriate actions or decisions.
    
    - Clearly define **roles and responsibilities** and ensure they are performed by competent people.
    
    - Ensure ethical behaviour and promote **transparency** in all actions and reporting.

### Governance in the Broader Context

- P3 governance is a necessary and integral component of overall **corporate governance**.

- This is increasingly demanded by shareholders, clients, and governments to ensure accountability and responsible management of investments.

- Many organisations must comply with external regulations and legislation, such as the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) in the USA.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Initially, governance can be perceived as just another layer of managerial bureaucracy. However, its true purpose is strategic. Good governance minimizes the risk arising from change, helps to maximize the benefits of investment, and is a key driver for avoiding common reasons for project failure.

### Benefits of Good Governance

- Optimisation of investment and resources.

- Avoidance of common reasons for project, programme, and portfolio failure.

- Motivation of staff through clarity of roles, responsibilities, and objectives.

- Promotion of the continued development and maturity of the P3 management discipline and profession.

### Core Components of Governance (Praxis Framework)

- While all topics in P3 management contribute to governance, the key areas are:
    
    - **P3 Management**: The methods and frameworks used to deliver the work.
    
    - **Knowledge Management**: The organisation’s ability to capture, learn from, and improve its capabilities.
    
    - **Life Cycle**: The structured phases that underpin delivery.
    
    - **Capability Maturity**: The development of increasing levels of effectiveness and efficiency.
    
    - **Sponsorship**: The vital link between the P3 management team, strategic executive management, and business-as-usual operations.

- Other critical functions include:
    
    - **Stakeholder Management**: Applying principles of engagement and communication to all stakeholders in the P3 process.
    
    - **Ethics**: Ensuring all team members act with integrity and in the best interests of the stakeholders.

## The Host Organisation's Role in Governance

- Governance begins at the top. The board of the **host organisation** must ensure that P3 management is visibly and proactively promoted and supported.

- To "own" and manage P3 governance, organisations create various structures. The names of these structures often reflect their scope and responsibilities.

### Common Governance Structures

- **PSO (Project Support Office)**: Typically provides predominantly administrative support to a single project.

- **PMO (Project Management Office)**: Can have a broad remit, often acting as the management organisation for a portfolio.

- **P3O® (Portfolio, Programme, and Project Support Office)**: A model that provides a range of support and governance functions across all P3 initiatives.

- **CoE (Centre of Excellence)**: Usually concentrates on improving capability maturity, developing standards and best practices, and supporting continuing professional development (CPD).

- **CoP (Community of Practice)**: A less formal structure focused on sharing knowledge and experience among practitioners.

## Governance at the Project, Programme, and Portfolio Levels

### Application Without a Corporate Structure

- The principles of good governance are universal. Even if a less mature organisation lacks an established corporate P3 governance structure, individual projects and programmes are **not exempt** from applying these principles.

- Where centrally driven governance is not in place, the project or programme team, led by the sponsor, must take responsibility for establishing and applying governance themselves.

### The Role of the Sponsor and Assurance

- The **sponsor** is ultimately responsible for ensuring that appropriate governance mechanisms are in place for their project or programme.

- **Assurance** is the process of periodically checking that these governance mechanisms are being applied correctly and are effective.

- Assurance should be performed by someone **external** to the day-to-day management team who can provide an objective assessment and report directly to the sponsor.

### The Path to Capability Maturity

- The journey to P3 maturity often starts with **inconsistent governance** applied across an informal collection of projects.

- As an organisation develops, it may form programmes that group together projects with different, pre-existing governance approaches.

- A key challenge for programme and portfolio managers is to balance the risk of allowing these inconsistencies to continue against the benefits of establishing a **consistent approach**.

- In a mature organisation, the governance of the portfolio will drive and define the governance of all component projects and programmes, ensuring alignment and consistency.

### Multiple Portfolios

- Large organisations may have multiple portfolios, and there can be good reasons for them to have different governance frameworks.

- These reasons are often contextual, driven by factors such as:
    
    - Geography
    
    - Political environments
    
    - Specific regulatory requirements

- However, even with different frameworks, the **core values** and ethical principles of governance should remain consistent across the entire organisation and align with corporate governance.

## Governance in Joint Ventures

> [!WARNING]  
> Governance can become particularly tricky when two or more organisations, often with different cultures and processes, combine in a joint venture to run a portfolio, programme, or large project.

- In such cases, a clear and carefully agreed governance framework is critical for success. This should explicitly cover:
    
    1. **Decision-Making**: Arrangements for joint authority in making decisions and managing contacts with owners, stakeholders, and third parties.
    
    2. **Business Cases**: The business cases must clearly reflect the agreed apportionment of risk and reward between the partners.
    
    3. **Integration**: Arrangements that recognise the existing governance structures and the technical strengths and weaknesses of each co-owner.
    
    4. **Approval Mechanisms**: Formal gates or checkpoints that give the owners the opportunity to re-evaluate their continued participation.
    
    5. **Procedures**: Clear procedures for progress reporting, independent reviews, and, crucially, dispute resolution.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is the primary goal of P3 governance?
    - **A:** To provide a system of good practice that defines roles, balances stakeholder needs, monitors management, and ensures ethical, transparent delivery of projects, programmes, and portfolios.

- **Q:** Is P3 governance separate from corporate governance?
    - **A:** No, P3 governance is a necessary component of corporate governance, ensuring that an organisation's investments in change are managed responsibly.

- **Q:** Who is responsible for ensuring governance is in place for a specific project?
    - **A:** The sponsor.

- **Q:** What is "assurance" in the context of governance?
    - **A:** The periodic and independent checking that governance mechanisms are being applied correctly. It should be performed by someone external to the management team.

- **Q:** What is the difference between a PSO and a CoE?
    - **A:** A Project Support Office (PSO) is typically administrative, supporting a single project. A Centre of Excellence (CoE) is a strategic function focused on improving capability maturity and standards across the organisation.

- **Q:** Why is governance particularly challenging in a joint venture?
    - **A:** Because it involves merging the different cultures, processes, and objectives of two or more organisations, requiring carefully negotiated agreements on decision-making, risk, and dispute resolution.
