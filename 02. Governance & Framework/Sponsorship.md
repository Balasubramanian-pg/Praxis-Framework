# Comprehensive Study Notes: Sponsorship

## General Principles of Sponsorship

- **Definition**: Sponsorship provides the essential link between the organisation's senior leadership and the P3 management team. It establishes ownership of, and accountability for, the business case and ensures the work is governed effectively.

### The Goals of Sponsorship

- The sponsor's role is active, not passive. The primary goals and responsibilities are to:
    
    - Provide clear **ownership of the business case** and ensure it remains viable throughout the life cycle.
    
    - Act as a **champion** for the objectives of the project, programme, or portfolio, advocating for it at a senior level.
    
    - Make the critical **go/no-go decisions** at key points in the life cycle (e.g., at gate reviews).
    
    - Address issues, risks, and decisions that are **outside the scope of the manager’s authority**.
    
    - Oversee **assurance** activities to ensure the work is being managed effectively.
    
    - Give ad-hoc support, guidance, and direction to the management team.

### The Sponsor Role

- There are various names given to the role that provides sponsorship, including **Executive**, **Senior Responsible Owner (SRO)**, or **Client**. The Praxis Framework refers to the role simply as the **Sponsor**.

> [!WARNING]  
> A common reason for failure in less mature organisations occurs when the role of sponsor is not taken seriously. It must be an active role fulfilled by a committed individual who understands and performs the required activities. It is not a ceremonial title.

- Depending on the context and complexity of the work, sponsorship can be provided by an individual alone or with the support of others.

- When a sponsor is supported by other senior managers, this group is commonly referred to as a **project or programme board** (or steering committee).

- Within a board structure, the sponsor retains ultimate ownership of, and accountability for, the business case.

### The Sponsor-Manager Relationship

- The working relationship between the sponsor and the project/programme manager is critical to success.

- The sponsor relies on the manager for the day-to-day delivery and accurate reporting, while the manager relies on the sponsor for strategic direction, resources, and handling escalations.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This relationship is crucial when challenges arise. If the business case ceases to justify continuing investment, the sponsor and manager must work together to redefine the work or initiate a premature closure in a controlled manner.

### Assurance and Accountability

- The sponsor is usually responsible to others within the host organisation (or an external client) for the success of the work.

- This responsibility includes ensuring that the work is not only delivering its objectives but is also being _managed effectively_.

- The sponsor fulfills this duty through **assurance**, which is an independent review of the management of the work.

### Attributes of an Effective Sponsor

- A sponsor must be an individual who:
    
    - Has the **credibility and authority** to provide leadership that crosses corporate and departmental boundaries.
    
    - Is genuinely **enthusiastic** about the objectives and acts as a vocal champion.
    
    - Is both **able and willing** to commit the necessary time and energy to fulfill the role properly.

> [!TIP]  
> While sponsors do not need to be former project or programme managers, their job is made significantly easier if they have a good understanding of the manager's role, challenges, and processes.

## Sponsorship in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

- The specific application of the sponsor role must reflect the context and complexity of the work being undertaken.

### Project and Programme Sponsorship

- **Appointment and Tenure**:
    
    - Ideally, the sponsor is appointed early in the life cycle, soon after the initial mandate is issued.
    
    - The role continues until the end of the life cycle. The exact end point depends on the scope:
        
        - For simple projects delivering an output, this may be after the final output is completed and handed over.
        
        - For projects and programmes that include benefits realisation in their scope, the sponsor will typically remain in their role until the benefits are achieved and the business case is satisfied.

- **Client-Supplier Context**:
    
    - In a common scenario where a supplier organisation delivers a project for a client, the sponsor is typically from the client organisation, and the manager is from the supplier.
    
    - In this situation, it is highly beneficial to have a senior representative from the supplier organisation working with the sponsor as part of a project or programme board.

- **Stakeholder Environment**:
    
    - The seniority and credibility of the sponsor must be matched to the complexity of the **stakeholder environment**, not just the technical scope.
    
    - Even small projects can have powerful or difficult stakeholders. The sponsor needs excellent communication and influencing skills, especially when the work involves organisational change that may face opposition.

- **Combined Roles**:
    
    - In a programme or large project environment, an individual may combine sponsorship and managerial roles at different levels.
    
    - **Example**: A programme manager often acts as the _sponsor_ for the component projects within their programme. Similarly, a project manager for a large, complex project acts in a sponsor-like capacity to the project managers of supplier "sub-projects".

### Portfolio Sponsorship

- At the portfolio level, the sponsorship role typically expands to cover broader aspects of governance. The corresponding process is therefore often called the **portfolio governance process**.

- **Accountability**:
    
    - It is very unusual for a portfolio to have a single, focused business case like a project.
    
    - Instead, the portfolio sponsor is accountable for the **overall effectiveness** of the component projects and programmes in delivering the organisation's strategic objectives.

- **Broader Responsibilities**:
    
    - The portfolio sponsor's role is as much about supporting and promoting the **discipline and profession of P3 management** as it is about the objectives of individual initiatives.
    
    - They must ensure that the portfolio performs consistently and that the organisation's capability to deliver change improves over time.

> [!NOTE]  
> One effective way for a portfolio sponsor to drive improvement is by using a capability maturity framework. This provides a structured approach to assessing and developing the organisation's P3 management practices.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is the single most important thing a sponsor is accountable for?
    - **A:** The business case.

- **Q:** What is "assurance" and who is responsible for overseeing it?
    - **A:** Assurance is the independent review of the management of the work. The sponsor is responsible for overseeing it.

- **Q:** In a project board, who retains ultimate accountability for the business case?
    - **A:** The sponsor.

- **Q:** How must a sponsor's seniority be matched to the work?
    - **A:** It must reflect the complexity of the stakeholder environment, not just the technical scope or budget.

- **Q:** How does sponsorship at the portfolio level differ from project sponsorship?

    - **A:** A portfolio sponsor is accountable for the overall effectiveness of the portfolio in achieving strategic objectives, rather than a single business case. Their role is also focused on promoting the P3M profession and improving organisational capability.
