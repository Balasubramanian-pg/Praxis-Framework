# Comprehensive Study Notes: Ethics

## General Principles of Ethics

- **Definition**: Ethics are the moral principles that govern someone’s behaviour or the way they perform an activity.

- Ethical behaviour can be considered the **cornerstone of competence** in any professional environment. It builds the trust and respect necessary for effective leadership and collaboration.

- For this reason, most professional bodies (e.g., PMI®, APM) have a formal **code of conduct** to which all their members must commit to adhere.

### The Goals of Ethics in a P3M Context

- The primary goals of promoting and defining ethics within the P3 management discipline are to:
    
    1. Encourage consistent **ethical behaviour** in all practitioners of project, programme, and portfolio management.
    
    2. Raise the standards of **professionalism** by which P3 managers are judged, and in doing so, raise the overall status of the P3 management profession.

## The Subjective and Contextual Nature of Ethics

- One of the inherent problems with defining and applying ethics is that it is, to some degree, **subjective**. What is considered moral and ethical in one culture may not be the same in another.

### Navigating Different Codes and Laws

- A P3 manager operates within a complex web of ethical and legal guidelines. They need to understand:
    
    - The different moral values and cultural norms of their various **stakeholders**.
    
    - The relevant **national and international laws** that apply to their work (e.g., the UK Bribery Act).
    
    - The **professional codes of conduct** they are bound by.
    
    - The specific **company codes of conduct** of their own organisation, their client, and key suppliers.

> [!WARNING]  
> Sometimes, these different sets of guidelines may conflict with one another. While statutory legislation clearly takes precedence, a P3 manager must be acutely aware of where professional codes and company codes may differ. If a professional believes there are conflicts or significant differences in the various codes, they must seek advice or formal direction from a relevant authority (e.g., their professional body, their company's legal department, or their sponsor).

## Ethics in Practice

### More Than Just Rules

- Behaving ethically is not just a passive activity of following guidelines and staying within the law. It is an active principle that **permeates all the competencies** of P3 management.

- Obvious connections can be made to interpersonal skills and functions such as **influencing** and **negotiation**. A manager who is seen to act unethically in these areas will very quickly lose the trust and respect of their stakeholders, making their job almost impossible.

### A Team Responsibility

- The need for ethical behaviour is not limited to the manager alone.

- A project, programme, or portfolio’s ethical values, or its own specific code of conduct, must be:
    
    - **Clearly articulated** to everyone involved.
    
    - **Understood** by all team members.
    
    - **Maintained** by all team members.

- This can be achieved through dedicated training, the provision of specific guidance for difficult situations, and including ethical conduct as part of the formal **assurance** process.

## Broader Ethical Considerations

- Ethical considerations do not just apply to the management processes (the "how"). The P3 manager must also be aware of the ethical impact of the **outputs, outcomes, and benefits** of the work itself (the "what").

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> One of the most important and prominent examples of this is the focus on environmental sustainability. A truly ethical approach requires that the principles of sustainability are considered in all aspects of project, programme, and portfolio delivery, from the initial option analysis to the final decommissioning of the product.

### Transparency and Accountability

- Society in general is demanding increasing **transparency** from organisations and expecting professionals to behave in a consistently ethical manner.

- In this environment, the P3 manager needs to be able to not only _take_ ethical decisions but also be able to clearly _explain_ those decisions in a way that maintains the commitment and trust of all stakeholders.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are ethics in a professional context?
    - **A:** The moral principles that govern a person's behaviour or how they perform an activity. They are the cornerstone of professional competence.

- **Q:** What are the two main goals of promoting ethics in P3M?
    - **A:** 1. To encourage ethical behaviour in practitioners, and 2. To raise the standards and status of the P3M profession.

- **Q:** Why can ethics be difficult to apply in practice?
    - **A:** Because ethics can be subjective and vary between different cultures. A manager must also navigate potential conflicts between laws, professional codes, and company policies.

- **Q:** Is ethical behaviour only the responsibility of the manager?
    - **A:** No. A project or programme's ethical values must be clearly articulated, understood, and maintained by all team members.

- **Q:** Beyond the management process, where else must a P3 manager consider the ethical impact?
    - **A:** They must consider the ethical impact of the outputs, outcomes, and benefits of the work itself, with environmental sustainability being a key example.
