# Comprehensive Study Notes: Organisation Management

## General Principles of Organisation Management

- **Definition**: Organisation management is concerned with creating and maintaining a management structure that is applicable to the specific project, programme, or portfolio and the context in which it operates.

### The Goals of Organisation Management

- The primary goals of organisation management are to:
    
    1. Design an organisation structure that is appropriate to the scope of the work to be managed.
    
    2. Identify and appoint competent members to the management team.
    
    3. Maintain and adapt the organisation structure throughout the life cycle as needs change.

### The Organisation Management Procedure

- The procedure for managing the P3 organisation is a simple one:
    
    1. **Plan**: Design an appropriate organisation structure, including role descriptions and policies for appointing staff, often cross-referencing the host organisation's HR policies.
    
    2. **Initiate**: Make the appointments to the roles defined in the plan and deliver any necessary induction or training.
    
    3. **Amend**: Adapt and change the organisation structure as required to meet the changing demands of the work throughout the life cycle.
    
    4. **Close**: Formally close down and disband the organisation structure at the end of the work.

> [-NOTE]  
> There is a strong correlation between the "initiate" and "close" steps in organisation management and the "mobilise" and "demobilise" steps in the mobilisation function. The key difference is that organisation management deals with the management team, while mobilisation deals with the delivery resources.

## The Four Levels of a P3 Organisation

- The organisational structure of individual projects, programmes, and portfolios will vary according to the context, but in broad terms, the organisation will always have four main levels.

1. **External Level**:
    
    - This represents the body that first mandated the work.
    
    - It could be a company board mandating a portfolio, a client mandating a project, or a programme mandating a sub-project.
    
    - This level delegates the responsibility for looking after its interests to the sponsorship level.

2. **Sponsorship Level**:
    
    - This level provides the crucial link between the management team and the external level.
    
    - The **sponsor** champions the work and owns the business case.

3. **Management Level**:
    
    - This is where the day-to-day responsibility for managing the work resides.
    
    - The sponsorship and management levels together form the **management team** (e.g., project management team, programme management team).

4. **Delivery Level**:
    - This level represents the staff, contractors, and suppliers who are directly involved in creating the products and delivering the work.

### The Relative Nature of the Levels

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> All the levels in this structure are relative and context-sensitive. For example, a project management team is at the "management level" for its project, but it is at the "delivery level" from the perspective of the programme that commissioned it. From the project team's perspective, the programme management team is their "sponsor". The entire structure depends upon good delegation and control systems.

### Supporting Functions

- Alongside this main four-level structure are two key supporting functions:
    
    - **Assurance**: An assurance team reports directly to the sponsor and provides confidence that the management and delivery of the work are being conducted effectively and appropriately.
    
    - **Support**: The support function (e.g., a PMO or PSO) provides administrative and technical services to both the management and delivery levels.

### The Matrix Organisation

- In a **matrix organisation**, which is very common, delivery resources and sometimes management resources report to both their functional **line manager** and to the **project or programme manager**.

- This dual reporting structure can create conflict between the two sources of authority and is a key challenge that must be recognised and managed.

## Organisation Structures in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Project Organisation

- The sponsor is an individual, who may be supported by a group of senior managers on larger projects, often called a **project board** or **steering group**.

- The composition of this sponsorship level is highly context-sensitive. If the project is within a programme, the programme manager might be the sponsor. If it's a client-contractor project, the board may include representatives from both.

- On small projects, the support and team manager responsibilities are often taken on by the project manager.

- The project organisation is often represented by an **Organisational Breakdown Structure (OBS)**. When combined with a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), it can produce a **Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM)**, like a RACI chart.

### Programme Organisation

- The main addition to the basic organisation structure when managing programmes is the role of the **Business Change Manager (BCM)**.

- BCMs are responsible for the change management and benefits management activities required to achieve the benefits set out in the business case.

- The programme sponsor is usually supported by a group of senior managers, often called the **sponsoring group**. This group should comprise senior managers from the business units most affected by the programme to ensure alignment and buy-in.

### Portfolio Organisation

- In a portfolio, there are typically only **three organisational levels**. The external and sponsorship levels are, in effect, one and the same.

- This combined external/sponsorship level is usually accountable not only for delivering the portfolio’s objectives but also for the development of the **discipline and profession of P3 management** across the organisation.

- Ideally, someone on the main board of the host organisation will represent P3 management, effectively making that person the **sponsor of the portfolio**.

- The day-to-day management of a portfolio is sometimes handled by a group known as a **Project Management Office (PMO)**.

- In this context, the PMO is synonymous with the **portfolio management team**. It manages the portfolio and may also be responsible for the overall development and promotion of P3 management in the host organisation.
