# Manage Risk

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Manage Risk Competency

## Purpose of the Competency

- The purpose of this competency is to demonstrate the ability to achieve the goals of risk management. These goals are to:
    
    - Ensure that levels of **overall risk** within a project, programme, or portfolio are compatible with organisational objectives.
    
    - Ensure that individual **risks and their responses** are identified and managed.
    
    - Minimise the impact of **threats** to the objectives.
    
    - Optimise the realisation of **opportunities** within the scope of the work.

---

## Performance Criteria

- An individual must be able to demonstrate the ability to perform the following actions:

- **Plan and initiate risk management**
    
    - This involves defining the approach, procedures, tools, and techniques that will be used for all risk management activities.
    
    - The output is the **risk management plan**, which also documents the roles and responsibilities for risk management.

- **Identify risk events**
    
    - This is the practical application of risk identification techniques.
    
    - It involves working with stakeholders to identify both potential threats and opportunities that could affect the work's objectives.
    
    - This includes using tools like brainstorming, checklists, interviews, and reviewing lessons learned from previous work.

- **Assess the probability and impact of risk events**
    
    - This involves analysing the identified risks to understand their significance.
    
    - For each risk, this means estimating its **probability** (likelihood of occurring) and its potential **impact** on the objectives if it does occur. This can be done using qualitative (e.g., High/Medium/Low) or quantitative methods.

- **Plan responses to risk events**
    
    - This involves deciding on the most appropriate course of action for each significant risk.
    
    - For **threats**, this could be to Avoid, Reduce, Transfer, or Accept the risk.
    
    - For **opportunities**, this could be to Exploit, Enhance, Share, or Reject the opportunity.

- **Implement responses to risk events and maintain acceptable levels of overall risk**
    
    - This is the execution step. It involves carrying out the planned proactive risk responses (e.g., implementing a mitigation action).
    
    - It also involves managing the overall level of risk to ensure it remains within the organisation's risk appetite.

- **Maintain risk management documentation**
    
    - This involves creating and maintaining the key risk documents, primarily the **risk register**.
    
    - The risk register is a living document that records all identified risks, their assessment, their planned responses, their owners, and their current status.

- **Monitor and control risk management**
    
    - This is an ongoing activity throughout the life cycle.
    
    - It involves regularly reviewing the risk register, tracking the effectiveness of risk responses, identifying new and emerging risks, and closing risks that are no longer relevant.

- **Assure the quality of risk management**
    - This involves ensuring that the agreed-upon procedures for managing risk are being followed correctly by the team and that the risk management process itself is effective.

> [NOTE]  
> The approach an organisation takes to managing risk is highly dependent upon its risk context (its attitude and appetite for risk). This competency must be adjusted to meet the different appetites and attitudes relevant to the specific work. For example, the risk profile of an entrepreneurial tech company is very different from that of an aid charity working in a war zone, and the competency of their staff must reflect this.

## Knowledge and Understanding

- An individual needs to know and understand the following principles and concepts:

- **The principles and goals of risk management**
    - Understanding that risk management is a proactive process to minimise threats and maximise opportunities, thereby improving the chances of success.

- **Responsibilities for risk management**
    - Knowing who is responsible for what, including the role of the P3 manager, the sponsor, risk owners, and the support office.

- **The context of the work and its impact on risk management**
    - Understanding how factors like complexity, uncertainty, and the industry will influence the risk profile and the appropriate management approach.

- **A procedure for risk management**
    - Understanding the typical iterative flow of the risk management procedure: Plan, Identify, Assess, Plan Responses, and Implement Responses.

- **The purpose and content of risk management documentation**
    - Knowing the purpose and structure of the **risk management plan** (the "how-to" guide) and the **risk register** (the live log of all risks).

- **Methods for identifying risk and appropriate sources of information**
    - Knowing various identification techniques such as brainstorming, checklists, the Delphi technique, and lessons learned reviews.

- **Techniques for assessing threats and opportunities**
    - Understanding both **qualitative** techniques (e.g., Probability-Impact Matrix) and **quantitative** techniques (e.g., Expected Monetary Value, Monte Carlo analysis).

- **Types, and appropriate use, of risk response actions**
    - Knowing the different response strategies for threats (Avoid, Reduce, Transfer, Accept) and opportunities (Exploit, Enhance, Share, Reject) and when to apply them.

- **Risk attitude and risk appetite**
    - Understanding the difference between **risk attitude** (an individual's or group's natural reaction to uncertainty) and **risk appetite** (the amount of risk an organisation is consciously prepared to take).

- **How risk events and overall risk may change during the life cycle**
    - Understanding that the risk profile of a project or programme is not static and must be continuously monitored as new risks emerge and old ones change.

- **How assurance applies to risk management**
    - Understanding how to review the risk management function to ensure that the process is being followed correctly and is effective.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the four primary goals of risk management?
    - **A:** 1. Ensure overall risk is compatible with objectives, 2. Ensure individual risks are identified and managed, 3. Minimise the impact of threats, and 4. Optimise opportunities.

- **Q:** What is the key document used to record and track all identified risks?
    - **A:** The Risk Register.

- **Q:** Name two response strategies for a threat and two for an opportunity.
    - **A:** **Threats**: Avoid, Reduce, Transfer, Accept. **Opportunities**: Exploit, Enhance, Share, Reject.

- **Q:** What is the difference between qualitative and quantitative risk assessment?
    - **A:** **Qualitative** assessment is based on subjective judgement and descriptive scales (e.g., High/Medium/Low). **Quantitative** assessment uses numerical and statistical methods to model the effect of uncertainty.

- **Q:** What is the difference between risk attitude and risk appetite?
    - **A:** **Risk attitude** is the inherent, natural reaction to uncertainty. **Risk appetite** is the conscious, strategic decision about how much risk to take.
