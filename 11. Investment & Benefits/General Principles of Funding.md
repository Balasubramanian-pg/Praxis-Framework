# Comprehensive Study Notes: Funding

## General Principles of Funding

- **Definition**: Funding is the means by which the finance required to undertake a project, programme, or portfolio is secured and made available to perform the work.

### The Goals of Funding

- The primary goals of this function are to:
    
    1. Determine the **best way to fund** the work.
    
    2. Secure **commitment** from the fundholders.
    
    3. Manage the **release of funds** throughout the life cycle.

## The Funding Procedure

1. **Identify Funding Sources**:
    
    - The first step is to identify the possible sources of funding. These could be internal, external, or a combination.
    
    - The scale can range from a simple allocation from a single departmental budget to the complex international financing of a joint venture.
    
    - In some cases, the work may be expected to be **self-funding**, with revenues generated from earlier stages of work providing the funds to deliver later stages.

2. **Negotiate Funding Terms**:
    
    - **Internal Funding**: It is unlikely that formal terms need to be negotiated, but conditions may be applied and must be recorded in the finance management plan.
    
    - **External Funding**: Where funding is provided by an external body (e.g., a bank, shareholders), terms and conditions will need to be formally negotiated. This can include interest rates, charges, and procedures for the release of funds. Complex funding arrangements may require specialist expertise.

3. **Secure Funding Commitment**:
    - Through the life cycle, as plans are defined in ever greater detail with increasing levels of confidence, funds will be formally committed, and approval will be given to commence work.

4. **Administer Funds**:
    - This step involves managing the release of funds in line with the life cycle phases and gate reviews:
        
        - **Initially**: Commit funds for the **identification process** and reserve funds in principle for the definition process.
        
        - **At the end of identification**: Commit funds for the **definition process** and reserve funds in principle for the delivery process.
        
        - **At the end of definition**: Commit funds for the **delivery process**, or at least for the first stage or tranche of work.
        
        - **At each subsequent review**: The release of funds for the next stage or tranche will be dependent upon a viable and re-approved business case.

> [IMPORTANT]  
> Whether they are internal or external, and whether they are direct recipients of benefits or not, funders must be treated as key stakeholders and managed accordingly.

## Funding in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Projects

- **Small Projects**: These tend to exist within departmental boundaries and are often funded from a single departmental operational budget. The project sponsor may well be the departmental manager who owns that budget.

- **Larger Projects**: As projects become larger, they often cross departmental boundaries and draw upon multiple budgets. The project sponsor is then more likely to be someone who is impartial and acceptable to the various budget holders. A **project board** may be formed to give representation to the key funding providers.

- **Contractor Projects**: When a contractor delivers a project for a client, the contractor’s funding effectively comes from the client.
    
    - Payments from the client to the contractor are usually based on valuations of work done at agreed points (milestones or regular periods).
    
    - The contractor will often need **bridging finance** to cover the time delay between paying their own bills (for staff, materials, etc.) and receiving the funds from the client.

- **Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)**: These are complex funding arrangements, often for major infrastructure projects, where governments partner with the private sector. A common model is **BOOT (Build, Own, Operate, Transfer)**, where a private organisation is given a concession to fund, build, and operate a facility for a period of time before transferring it back to the commissioning organisation.

### Programmes

- Programmes are very likely to involve multiple internal budgets. Even where a strategic programme is funded from central corporate resources, the change management activity in business-as-usual is often funded by the affected departments themselves.

- **Funding Distribution**: Having secured the overall funding for the programme, the programme management team is responsible for distributing funds to the component projects.

- **Benefits Focus**: The programme team must always be aware that they are really funding the **delivery of benefits**; the projects are simply the means of creating the outputs that enable those benefits.

- With a focus on the overall business case, funds will be allocated and re-allocated in accordance with the benefits they create. This may involve moving funds between projects, re-scoping projects, or even cancelling them in order to use the funds more effectively elsewhere in the programme.

### Portfolios

- **Standard Portfolios**: These are often made up of projects delivered for clients. Most of the portfolio budget is simply the aggregation of the various project budgets. However, managing the client projects as a portfolio may provide the opportunity to use the positive cash flow of some projects to provide bridging finance for others, thus avoiding the need for more expensive external funds.

- **Strategic Portfolios**:
    
    - A strategic portfolio is typically funded as part of the organisation's annual or multi-year **business planning cycle**.
    
    - Ideally, the objectives of the portfolio will be delivered within the same time frame as the funding cycle. If not, the portfolio runs the risk of having its funding changed or cut in the next business planning cycle.
    
    - The prioritisation and balancing of projects and programmes within a strategic portfolio will, to a large degree, depend upon how it is funded.
    
    - For example, if there is uncertainty regarding future funding availability, long-term secured funds should be used for the longer, high-priority programmes, while short-term funds should be matched to shorter-term projects.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the three primary goals of the funding function?
    - **A:** 1. To determine the best way to fund the work, 2. To secure commitment from fundholders, and 3. To manage the release of funds throughout the life cycle.

- **Q:** Why must funders always be treated as key stakeholders?
    - **A:** Because their commitment is essential for the work to proceed, and their requirements and concerns must be managed to ensure continued support.

- **Q:** What is "bridging finance" in the context of a contractor project?
    - **A:** The temporary financing a contractor needs to cover their own costs during the time delay between paying their bills and receiving payment from the client.

- **Q:** What is the primary focus of a programme management team when allocating funds to its projects?
    - **A:** They must focus on funding the **delivery of benefits**. This means they may re-allocate funds between projects to wherever they will create the most value for the overall programme business case.

- **Q:** How does the business planning cycle affect the funding of a strategic portfolio?
    - **A:** The portfolio is typically funded as part of the cycle. If the portfolio's objectives extend beyond the cycle, it runs the risk of having its funding changed or cut in the next cycle, which can impact its component projects and programmes.
