# Comprehensive Study Notes: Investment Appraisal

## General Principles of Investment Appraisal

- **Definition**: Investment appraisal is a collection of techniques used to identify the financial and non-financial attractiveness of an investment in a project or programme.

### The Goals of Investment Appraisal

- The primary goals of this function are to:
    
    1. Assess the financial **viability** of achieving the objectives.
    
    2. Support the production of a robust **business case**.

- **Timing**: Investment appraisal is very focused on the **early phases** of a project or programme. It is performed in parallel with the early work on developing management plans and delivery plans.

## The Investment Appraisal Procedure

1. **Plan and Initiate**:
    
    - For programmes and portfolios, these steps are necessary to establish **consistent appraisal techniques** across all component projects.
    
    - For stand-alone projects, these steps are typically absorbed within the broader **identification and definition processes**.

2. **Collect Data**:
    
    - This is the first specific step. It involves collecting the relevant information needed for the appraisal.
    
    - During the **identification process**, this data will be "top-down," based on comparative or parametric estimating techniques.
    
    - During the **definition process**, it will be a summary of detailed, "bottom-up" delivery planning.
    
    - This should be done in conjunction with stakeholders to ensure that all relevant subjective (e.g., dis-benefits) and objective inputs have been captured.

3. **Perform Appraisal**:
    - The appraisal is performed using a combination of suitable financial and non-financial techniques.

4. **Report Results**:
    - The results of the appraisal are formally reported, usually as the core justification section of the **business case**.

## Key Concepts in Investment Appraisal

### Factors Beyond Cash Flow

- While most investment appraisals are based on cash flows, other important factors may need to be included, such as:
    
    - **Legal Considerations**: A project may be compulsory to conform to new legislation, making a simple return on investment appraisal less relevant.
    
    - **Environmental Impact**: The effects of the work on the natural environment are an increasingly important factor.
    
    - **Social Impact**: For charities or public sector work, the return could be measured in non-financial terms like "quality of life" or "lives saved."
    
    - **Operational Benefits**: These could include less tangible elements like "increased customer satisfaction," "higher staff morale," or "competitive advantage."
    
    - **Risk**: An investment may be justified because it reduces an organisation's business or operational risk.

### Financial Appraisal Techniques

- At the heart of an investment appraisal is a comparison between investment (cost) and return (benefit). To be objective, both sides should be measured in cash where possible.

- **Payback Method**:
    
    - Calculates the **payback period**—the time it takes for the value of the benefits to equal the cost of the work.
    
    - It is a relatively crude mechanism but can be useful for initial screening of ideas.

- **Accounting Rate of Return (ARR)**:
    
    - Expresses the average annual "profit" from an investment as a percentage of the costs.
    
    - Its main disadvantage is that it **does not take the timing of cash flows into account**.

- **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Techniques**:
    
    - These are more appropriate where there is a significant time difference between the expenditure and the financial return, as they account for the time value of money.
    
    - **Net Present Value (NPV)**: Calculates the present value of all cash flows associated with an investment by applying a discount rate. A positive NPV is good; the higher the NPV, the better the investment.
    
    - **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**: Calculates the discount rate that would give an NPV of zero. This percentage can be compared to the organisation's "hurdle rate" for investments.

### Challenges in Investment Appraisal

- **Optimism Bias**: One of the biggest issues is the tendency for sponsors and teams to be over-optimistic in their estimates of the value of benefits. Some appraisal approaches use an adjustment for optimism bias, where initial benefit estimates are reduced before being included in the business case.

- **Quantifying Intangible Benefits**: The potential for optimism is greatest when benefits are difficult to quantify. Assumptions used to assign a financial value to an intangible benefit (e.g., improved staff morale leads to lower recruitment costs) must be carefully documented and reviewed.

> [CAUTION]  
> Appraisals should not be overly dependent on non-financial benefits. Anything can be justified through purely subjective views of value. The quantifiable financial benefits should provide a robust foundation for the business case.

## Investment Appraisal in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Projects

- Many projects are only concerned with delivering an output and have no direct involvement in the benefits realisation process.

- Even if the project management team did not prepare the initial investment appraisal, the project manager should be familiar with it and is usually given responsibility for **maintaining the business case** and updating the appraisal as the project progresses.

- In a **client-contractor** scenario, the contractor's project team may perform their own investment appraisal that balances their costs and risks against the agreed price and payment terms.

### Programmes

- A programme will have an overall business case but may also take responsibility for performing separate investment appraisals of its component projects.

- The programme management team must set out **standards for appraisal** in a finance management plan to ensure a consistent approach across all projects.

- This is particularly important because a single benefit may be derived from multiple project outputs, and the full value of that benefit cannot be claimed by any one project. Consistent techniques are needed so that individual project business cases can be aggregated into tranche or programme-level business cases without double-counting.

### Portfolios

- The portfolio management process includes an activity where projects and programmes are selected for inclusion. Investment appraisal is a key tool in this selection process.

- The portfolio management team must establish a system for capturing and **screening** ideas for new projects or programmes. This is where simpler techniques like **payback** and **ARR** may be used for an initial filter.

- For example, a criterion may be set that requires payback within the organisation's financial planning cycle. Any ideas that do not meet this are discarded.

- As the higher-potential ideas are captured, they will be subjected to more detailed and rigorous appraisal techniques like NPV and IRR to support the **prioritisation and balancing** activities.

## Flashcard Q-&A

- **Q:** What are the two primary goals of investment appraisal?
    - **A:** 1. To assess the financial viability of the work, and 2. To support the production of a robust business case.

- **Q:** Name two non-financial factors that might be included in an investment appraisal.
    - **A:** Any two from: Legal/regulatory compliance, environmental impact, social impact, operational benefits (e.g., morale), or risk reduction.

- **Q:** What is the main disadvantage of the Accounting Rate of Return (ARR) method?
    - **A:** It does not take the timing of income and expenditure into account (the time value of money).

- **Q:** What are the two main discounted cash flow (DCF) techniques?
    - **A:** Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR).

- **Q:** What is "optimism bias" in the context of investment appraisal?
    - **A:** The tendency for sponsors and teams to be over-optimistic in their estimates of the value of benefits that a project or programme will deliver.

- **Q:** How might a portfolio management team use simpler appraisal techniques like payback?
    - **A:** As an initial screening tool to filter out ideas for new projects or programmes that do not meet a basic financial threshold before committing to a more detailed appraisal.
