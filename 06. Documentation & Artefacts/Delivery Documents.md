# Delivery Documents

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Delivery Documents

## General Principles of Delivery Documents

- **Role and Purpose**: While management plans set out the governance principles ("how to manage") and scope documents define the objectives ("what to achieve"), delivery documents are at the heart of **actually doing the work**.

- **Content**: They are the working-level documents used for the day-to-day management, control, and execution of the project, programme, or portfolio.

### Context and Governance

- The specific delivery documents to be used, their format, and how they should be maintained are all defined in the **management plans** (the governance documents).

- They are primarily created and used in the active management processes:
    
    - **Delivery Process**
    
    - **Development Process**
    
    - **Boundaries Process**

### Dynamic Nature

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Delivery documents are the most dynamic of the three documentation groups. They are constantly being updated with progress, new information, and the results of management actions.

- Because of their dynamic nature, they must be maintained in accordance with the principles set out in the:
    
    - **Information Management Plan**: To ensure they are accurate, accessible, and distributed correctly.
    
    - **Configuration Management Plan**: To ensure that versions are controlled and that everyone is working from the correct baseline.

## Examples of Common Delivery Documents

- **Schedules / Plans**: Detailed timetables showing what work will be done and when (e.g., Gantt charts, milestone charts).

- **Registers and Logs**: Dynamic lists used to track specific management items.
    
    - **Risk Register**: Records identified risks, their assessment, and their response plans.
    
    - **Issue Log**: Records and tracks issues that require management action.
    
    - **Change Log**: Records all change requests and their status.
    
    - **Lessons Log**: Captures lessons as they are learned throughout the life cycle.

- **Reports**: Documents used to communicate status and performance.
    
    - **Progress Report / Highlight Report**: Provides a regular summary of progress for stakeholders.
    
    - **Checkpoint Report**: A more detailed, frequent report from a team to the P_3 manager.
    
    - **Exception Report**: A report created to escalate an issue where tolerances have been or are predicted to be exceeded.

- **Work Packages**: Documents that define and authorise a specific piece of work to be done by a team or individual.
