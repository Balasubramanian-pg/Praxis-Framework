# Management Plans

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Management Plans

## General Principles of Management Plans

- **Definition**: Management plans are a category of **governance documents**. They set out the way a specific function (e.g., risk, scope, finance) will be managed for a project, programme, or portfolio.

- They are distinct from **delivery plans**, which explain the detail of _how_ a specific piece of work will be delivered (the "what" and "when"). Management plans explain _how the management of the work_ will be governed (the "how to manage").

### The Purpose of Management Plans

- Management plans define the policies, procedures, tools, and techniques to be used for a specific management function.

- They provide the "rulebook" for that area of management.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The principle behind having management plans is simply that there are many functions that need to be managed, and it is important to think about and agree on how that will be done. The range and detail of management plans should always be consistent with the complexity of the work.

### Timing of Creation

- **Portfolios**: Governance documents, including management plans, will be created in the **initiation process** of the portfolio.

- **Projects and Programmes**: They are formally prepared and tailored in the **definition process**.

### The "Chicken and Egg" Problem

- It may seem odd that high-level scope and delivery documents are produced in the **identification process**, seemingly _before_ the management plans that govern them are created in the definition process.

- This is resolved in a mature organisation:
    
    - **Standard Forms**: The organisation will have **standard, generic management plans** that exist as templates.
    
    - **Identification Phase**: Competent members of the identification team use these standard documents as a guide for their work and documentation during the identification process.
    
    - **Definition Phase**: During the definition process, these standard governance documents are then formally **tailored** to the specific context of the project or programme, providing detailed guidance for all subsequent work.

## The Structure of a Management Plan

- The document descriptions in Praxis are generic and will always need to be tailored to suit the context of the work. A typical management plan has two main sections: Policy and Procedure.

### 1. Policy Section

- This section sets out the high-level rules and principles for the function. It typically includes sections on:
    
    - **Roles and Responsibilities**: Who is responsible for what within this function.
    
    - **Information Management**: How information related to this function will be created, stored, and distributed.
    
    - **Assurance**: How the application of this function will be assured.
    
    - **Budget**: Any specific budget allocated for performing the function itself (e.g., for risk management software or workshops).
    
    - **Interfaces**: How this function interacts with other management functions.

### 2. Procedure Section

- This section describes the practical application of the policy. It typically includes:
    
    - A definition of the **steps to be used** in performing the function (e.g., the steps of the risk management procedure).
    
    - Detailed recommendations on the **tools and techniques** to be used in each step.

## Tailoring and Application

- Management plans are created according to the needs of the work.

- If appropriate, multiple functions may be merged into a single, consolidated management plan (e.g., a "Scope and Change Management Plan").

- Conversely, a single, highly complex function may be sub-divided into multiple, more detailed plans.

> [!WARNING]  
> There is a danger that the list of potential management plans can appear highly bureaucratic and time-consuming to prepare. This is a misunderstanding of their purpose. A simple, one-page risk management plan for a small project is infinitely better than no plan at all. The goal is to apply the right level of thought and documentation for the level of complexity.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is the key difference between a management plan and a delivery plan?
    - **A:** A **management plan** is a governance document that describes _how a function will be managed_ (the "how to manage"). A **delivery plan** describes _how a specific piece of work will be delivered_ (the "what and when").

- **Q:** In which process are management plans for projects and programmes formally created and tailored?
    - **A:** In the Definition Process.

- **Q:** What are the two main sections of a typical management plan?
    - **A:** Policy and Procedure.

- **Q:** How does a mature organisation solve the problem of needing to follow management guidelines in the identification phase _before_ the formal plans are created?
    - **A:** The organisation has standard, generic management plans that are used as a guide during the identification phase and are then formally tailored to the specific project/programme during the definition phase.

- **Q:** What is the most important principle to remember when deciding on the number and detail of management plans for a project?
    - **A:** That the range and detail of the plans should be consistent with, and appropriate to, the complexity of the work.
