# Comprehensive Study Notes: Uncertainty and Agility

## The Roots of Agility: Understanding VUCA

- The concept of agility in project delivery has its roots in the idea of **VUCA**.

- VUCA is an acronym originally coined by the U.S. Army War College to describe the post-Cold War geopolitical landscape. It has since been widely adopted in business and management to describe challenging environments.

- The four elements of VUCA are:
    
    - **Volatility**: The speed, scale, and instability of change, which is often unexpected.
    
    - **Uncertainty**: The lack of predictability and reliability of events, which creates doubt and confusion.
    
    - **Complexity**: The interconnection and interdependence of multiple factors, making it difficult to analyze cause-and-effect relationships.
    
    - **Ambiguity**: The vagueness or lack of clarity in the meaning of situations, which can lead to misunderstanding and miscommunication.

- Projects and programmes are designed to achieve a unique set of objectives outlined in a business case. The more innovative or extensive the scope of this work, the greater the chance it will be affected by VUCA factors.

## From VUCA to Uncertainty: The Core Driver

- In an ideal project, everything would be predictable, leading to accurate budgets and certain completion dates. This perfect scenario never happens because there is always some degree of uncertainty.

- In the context of project delivery, it is most useful to focus on **uncertainty**. The other three VUCA elements—volatility, complexity, and ambiguity—all contribute to and create uncertainty.

> [!NOTE]  
> It is the level of uncertainty that is the fundamental factor that should determine the way we govern and manage P3 work.

- It is also useful to classify uncertainty into two types:
    
    - **Intrinsic Uncertainty**: Uncertainty that arises from the inherent nature of the work itself (e.g., using new technology, unclear objectives).
    
    - **Extrinsic Uncertainty**: Uncertainty that arises from the world outside the defined boundaries of the work (e.g., economic changes, new regulations, weather).

---

## How Standard P3 Functions Manage Uncertainty

- Many of the core functions of project and programme management are specifically designed to handle aspects of VUCA and reduce uncertainty.

- **Requirements Management**:
    
    - When defining objectives, the team must be realistic about what is predictable and what is not.
    
    - The approach to managing requirements must be adapted to the level of predictability, which will vary across different objectives and throughout the lifecycle.

- **Risk Management**:
    
    - This function is the essence of dealing with the unpredictable.
    
    - It involves identifying and mitigating specific risk events (known unknowns) and developing strategies to handle more general uncertainty (unknown unknowns).

- **Stakeholder Management**:
    
    - A significant amount of uncertainty comes from people—their reactions, expectations, support, or opposition.
    
    - Effective stakeholder management aims to reduce the uncertainty arising from the different individuals and groups who have an interest in the work.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> While nearly every element of project delivery plays a role in reducing uncertainty, it can never be completely eliminated. The goal is to manage uncertainty, not to pretend it doesn't exist.

## Defining Agility: The Response to Uncertainty

- A simple analogy helps to explain the concept of agility:
    
    - **Low Uncertainty (Sunny Day)**: Imagine walking across dangerous terrain on a bright, sunny day. The path is clear from your next step all the way to the horizon. You can be forward-looking, plan your route in detail, and progress with confidence.
    
    - **High Uncertainty (Thick Fog)**: Now imagine the same journey in a thick fog where you can only see two or three steps ahead. You must take smaller, more cautious steps and constantly check your compass and review your direction to ensure you are still on track.

- This is the essence of **agility**. Where there are high levels of intrinsic or extrinsic uncertainty, governance and management must be set up to:
    
    - Proceed **iteratively** (in small, manageable steps).
    
    - Quickly **respond and adapt** to changes that occur.

- Conversely, in more predictable contexts with low levels of uncertainty, we can afford to plan further ahead with more confidence, and the need for high agility is less critical.

## The Continuum of Agility

- Uncertainty is not a binary state (certain vs. uncertain); it exists on a graduated scale or a **continuum** from very high to very low.

- Logic dictates that if uncertainty exists on a continuum, then the way we manage the work must also exist on a continuum.

- In the Praxis Framework, this graduated progression of governance and management approaches is called the **continuum of agility**.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The continuum of uncertainty and the continuum of agility run in parallel. The level of agility applied to a project or programme must be appropriate for its level of uncertainty.
> 
> - **High Uncertainty requires High Agility.**
> 
> - **Low Uncertainty requires Low Agility.**

## Illustrating the Continuum: Practical Examples

### Low Intrinsic Uncertainty: Constructing a Bridge

- **Context**: The setting is known, the purpose is clear, the location can be surveyed, and the properties of the materials and designs are well-understood.

- **Uncertainty Profile**: The project has **low intrinsic uncertainty**. Most of this uncertainty (e.g., final design choice, ground conditions) can be resolved early in the lifecycle through detailed definition and planning.

- **Agility Application**: Most agility is applied in the early design phases. Once construction begins and concrete is set, the cost of change becomes very high, constraining agility. The project still faces _extrinsic_ uncertainty (e.g., weather, funding changes) which must be managed.

### High Intrinsic Uncertainty: Innovative Software Development

- **Context**: There may be a vision for what the application should achieve, but many different ways to achieve it. Success depends on unpredictable user interaction, and the underlying technology is constantly advancing.

- **Uncertainty Profile**: The project has **high intrinsic uncertainty**.

- **Agility Application**: Only a small amount of uncertainty can be resolved upfront. Most of it must be resolved through an iterative and incremental development process, gathering user feedback and adapting the product in small steps. This requires a high-agility approach.

## Factors Affecting Agility: Enablers and Constraints

- The ability to apply the appropriate level of agility is affected by several key factors.

- **1. Appetite for Change (Enabler)**:
    
    - High agility requires a culture where people (the team, stakeholders, and the organisation) are comfortable with frequent change and evolving objectives.
    
    - When everyone involved has a high appetite for change, agility is enabled. A rigid, change-averse culture will act as a constraint.

- **2. Cost of Change (Constraint)**:
    
    - If the cost of making a change is high, then change is less likely to be financially beneficial, and the potential for agility is reduced.
    
    - This is why physical construction projects (like the bridge) have a low tolerance for agility in later stages—the cost of change is prohibitive. In software, the cost of change is often much lower, enabling higher agility throughout.

- **3. Interdependencies (Constraint)**:
    
    - High agility is often associated with independent, self-managed teams.
    
    - If there are high levels of dependencies between different teams or components of a project, a greater level of overall coordination and central planning is needed.
    
    - This reduces the autonomy of individual teams and constrains the level of agility that can be effectively applied.

## Agility vs. Agile: A Critical Distinction

- In modern P3 management, it is easy to confuse the concept of **agility** with the specific methodologies of **Agile**. They are different concepts.

- **Agility (with a small 'a')**:
    
    - Refers to the **entire continuum** of responsiveness.
    
    - It is a fundamental principle that _all_ project delivery should be executed with an _appropriate_ level of agility that matches its level of uncertainty. A low-agility ("waterfall") approach is the correct choice for a low-uncertainty project.

- **Agile (with a capital 'A')**:
    
    - Refers to a specific set of frameworks, tools, and techniques (e.g., Scrum, Kanban) founded on the **Agile Manifesto** (2001).
    
    - These methods are specifically designed for the **high-uncertainty / high-agility** end of the continuum.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Agility is the broad concept that covers all approaches. Agile is a specific subset of high-agility methods. Saying a project needs to be "agile" is not the same as saying it needs to use "Agile".

## Applying Agility in Practice

- It is the responsibility of the initiation team to assess the work and its environment to identify the appropriate levels of agility needed.

- This assessment is not necessarily for the entire project or programme as a whole. Different components of the same initiative may have different levels of uncertainty and therefore require different levels of agility in their management.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What does the acronym VUCA stand for?
    - **A:** Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity.

- **Q:** What is the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic uncertainty?
    - **A:** **Intrinsic** uncertainty arises from the nature of the work itself (e.g., new technology). **Extrinsic** uncertainty arises from the external environment (e.g., economic changes).

- **Q:** What is the "continuum of agility"?
    - **A:** It is the principle that the management approach should exist on a graduated scale from low to high agility, in parallel with the project's level of uncertainty.

- **Q:** Why is the "cost of change" a constraint on agility?
    - **A:** If making changes is very expensive (e.g., altering a physical structure), it is not financially viable to be highly agile, which forces more planning to be done upfront.

- **Q:** What is the key difference between "agility" and "Agile"?
    - **A:** **Agility** is the broad concept of tailoring the management approach to the level of uncertainty across a full spectrum. **Agile** refers to specific methodologies (like Scrum) designed for the high-uncertainty end of that spectrum.
