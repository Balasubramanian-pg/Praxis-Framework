# Comprehensive Study Notes: Requirements Management

## General Principles of Requirements Management

- **Definition**: Requirements management is the function that establishes stakeholders’ wants and needs, and then reviews and reconciles these to create a single, agreed-upon set of baseline requirements. These requirements are then used as the primary input for solutions development and benefits management.

### The Goals of Requirements Management

- The primary goals of this function are to:
    
    1. Ensure that all relevant stakeholders have the opportunity to express their wants and needs.
    
    2. Reconcile multiple, and often conflicting, stakeholder requirements to create a single, viable set of objectives.
    
    3. Achieve stakeholder consensus on a **baseline set of requirements**.

- A clear and agreed expression of requirements and their associated acceptance criteria is essential for the success of any P3 initiative. Requirements may be expressed as physical deliverables (outputs), business benefits, aspirations, functions, or technical needs.

## The Requirements Management Procedure

1. **Plan**: Define the techniques and approaches that will be used to work with stakeholders to capture and agree on requirements.

2. **Initiate**: Ensure the necessary resources (e.g., business analysts) are mobilised so that requirements management can start.

3. **Capture Requirements**:
    
    - This is the first specific step. It involves capturing all types of requirements from various sources.
    
    - Most will be generated by internal and external stakeholders (such as clients and users), but there may also be a background of legal or regulatory requirements that must be included.
    
    - Techniques can range from personal interviews, surveys, and workshops to focus groups, modelling, and simulation.

4. **Analyse Requirements**:
    
    - The captured requirements must be analysed to ensure they are practical, achievable, and define **‘what’** is required rather than **‘how’** it will be achieved.
    
    - The analysis looks for any gaps, overlaps, or conflicts in what different stakeholders have asked for.
    
    - The result is a thorough understanding of the requirements and how they contribute to the overall objective.

5. **Consult Stakeholders**:
    
    - This step is primarily about providing feedback to stakeholders and building consensus.
    
    - The results of the analysis are communicated through individual consultations or group workshops, leading to a debate about the requirements.
    
    - This may well result in further requirements being captured and analysed in an iterative loop.

6. **Baseline Requirements**:
    
    - The eventual result of the capture-analyse-consult cycle is a **baselined set of requirements** that has been agreed upon by the key stakeholders.
    
    - These baselined requirements can then be used to examine alternative options during solutions development.

### Characteristics of a Well-Specified Requirement

- A good requirement is:
    
    - **Unique**: It addresses only one core need.
    
    - **Current**: It is up to date and relevant.
    
    - **Consistent**: It doesn’t conflict with other requirements.
    
    - **Understandable**: It is clear and unambiguous.
    
    - **Verifiable**: Compliance can be verified through inspection, demonstration, or testing.
    
    - **Traceable**: It can be traced from the originating need through to the delivered product.
    
    - **Prioritised**: Its importance is understood relative to other requirements.

## Value Management

- One well-established technique that addresses requirements management, solutions development, and some aspects of benefits management is **value management**.

- In the P3 environment, value is a means of maximising value for money and is represented by the ratio: **Value = Satisfaction of Requirements / Use of Resources**.

- The goal of value management is not to simply maximise the satisfaction of requirements, nor to simply minimise the use of resources, but to establish the **balance that maximises the ratio of the two**.

## Requirements Management in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Projects

- Initial requirements are defined at a high level during the **identification process**.

- Detailed requirements management is performed during the **definition process** to complete the full investment appraisal and business case.

- Even on small projects, "failure to fully understand stakeholder requirements" is one of the most common causes of project failure.

- **Agile Projects**: The requirements management procedure must be dynamic. It must use rigorous prioritisation mechanisms, such as **MoSCoW** (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have), to ensure that only valuable requirements are included in each package of work (e.g., a sprint or timebox).

### Programmes

- Programme requirements will typically be expressed as a combination of **outputs and benefits**. These often have complex relationships that can be described in a **benefits map**.

- The relationship between requirements management, solutions development, and benefits management is not entirely sequential. High-level analysis of benefits and solutions is needed _before_ a final baseline of requirements can be agreed upon.

- The programme management team is responsible for requirements management as it applies to the programme’s benefits. A key decision is how much responsibility for the requirements management of the outputs will be delegated to the component project teams.

- A useful dividing line is for the programme to express the **functional requirements** needed from an output (what it needs to do), while the project team manages the **technical requirements** that will deliver that functionality (how it will do it).

### Portfolios

- **Standard Portfolio**:
    
    - This is made up of projects and programmes with independent requirements.
    
    - The "requirements" of the portfolio itself are concerned with the efficient use of resources and the improvement of the P3M discipline. These requirements are set during the portfolio initiation process and remain fairly constant.

- **Structured Portfolio**:
    
    - The initial requirements of a structured portfolio are expressed in terms of the organisation’s **strategic objectives**.
    
    - The requirements management procedure in a structured portfolio assesses these strategic objectives and clarifies them with the executive board.
    
    - Most detailed requirements management activity is delegated to the component project and programme teams. However, the portfolio management team must perform two key functions:
        
        1. **Act as the interface** between the delivery teams and the executive board, ensuring that strategic requirements are accurately translated into projects and programmes.
        
        2. **Co-ordinate** the many localised requirements management processes to monitor for gaps, overlaps, and conflicts between the different initiatives in the portfolio.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the three primary goals of requirements management?
    - **A:** 1. Ensure all stakeholders have a chance to express their needs, 2. Reconcile multiple requirements into a single viable set, and 3. Achieve stakeholder consensus on a baseline of requirements.

- **Q:** What does it mean for a requirement to be "verifiable"?
    - **A:** It means that the compliance of a product designed to meet the requirement can be checked through inspection, demonstration, or testing.

- **Q:** What is the formula for "value" in value management?
    - **A:** Value = Satisfaction of Requirements / Use of Resources.

- **Q:** In an agile project, what technique is commonly used to prioritise requirements?
    - **A:** MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have).

- **Q:** In a programme, what is a useful way to divide responsibility for requirements between the programme and its projects?
    - **A:** The programme defines the **functional requirements** for the outputs (what they need to do), and the projects define the **technical requirements** (how they will be built to do it).

- **Q:** What are the two key requirements management functions of a structured portfolio team?
    - **A:** 1. To act as the interface between the executive board and the delivery teams, and 2. To co-ordinate the requirements processes of all component projects and programmes to check for gaps and overlaps.
