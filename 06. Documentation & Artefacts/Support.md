# Comprehensive Study Notes: Support in P3 Management

## General Principles of Support

- **Definition**: Support is a set of specialist and administrative services carried out on behalf of project, programme, or portfolio managers to help them deliver their objectives effectively and efficiently.

- The support infrastructure can be constituted in many different ways, ranging from a single person to a large, multi-disciplinary team.

### Goals of a Support Function

- Because the nature of support varies so widely with the context of the work, a single definitive set of goals is impractical. However, the goals are generally drawn from the following broad list:
    
    - Provide **administrative support** to P3 managers.
    
    - Support the **governance** of P3 management.
    
    - Provide specialist **technical support**.
    
    - Conduct **assurance**.

### Levels and Types of Support Services

- **Basic Administrative Support**:
    
    - This is required on all projects, programmes, and portfolios. While a project manager may handle this on a very small project, any medium-to-large initiative requires dedicated support for day-to-day administration.
    
    - Services include:
        
        - Providing administrative help in areas such as planning, risk management, and change control.
        
        - Acting as the secretariat for meetings (scheduling, minutes, actions).
        
        - Providing logistical services for members of the management team.

- **Technical and Specialist Support**:
    
    - This involves more advanced skills required by most programmes and portfolios.
    
    - Services include:
        
        - Collecting, analysing, and presenting progress information (reporting).
        
        - Managing and tracking interdependencies.
        
        - Handling communications with stakeholders.
        
        - Conducting **assurance** of governance structures and P3 management practices through audits, health checks, and phase-end reviews.

- **Sophisticated Strategic Support (often from a permanent, central function)**:
    
    - This level of support is focused on improving the organisation's overall P3 capability.
    
    - Services include:
        
        - Providing subject matter expertise to ensure teams have access to all necessary tools and techniques.
        
        - Offering training, coaching, and mentoring for P3 management teams.
        
        - Maintaining the infrastructure and momentum to support **communities of practice (CoPs)**.
        
        - Improving, embedding, and measuring P3 capabilities to achieve higher levels of **organisational maturity**.
        
        - Owning, deploying, and maintaining standard tools and techniques across the organisation.

### The Support Infrastructure

- The P3 support infrastructure can range from a single person to a large team containing many different roles and specialists. Common roles include:
    
    - Planners and Schedulers
    
    - Cost Engineers
    
    - Subject Matter Experts (e.g., in risk, benefits)
    
    - Assurance Staff
    
    - Configuration Managers

- **Temporary vs. Permanent Offices**:
    
    - **Temporary**: A support office might be created to provide administrative support to a _specific_ project or programme. This office is then disbanded once the work is complete.
    
    - **Permanent**: An organisation-wide support office has a permanent role, independent of the creation or completion of any individual piece of work. It focuses on providing consistent support and improving overall capability.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The shape of the support infrastructure must reflect its context, but its component groups must always have a clearly defined purpose and scope. The roles and levels of authority of these support groups must be clearly communicated to the delivery teams and reinforced periodically to avoid confusion and conflict.

## Support in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Project Support

- When a project is part of a larger programme or portfolio, the project support function will typically be provided by the higher-level programme or portfolio office. This ensures consistency and efficiency.

- For smaller, stand-alone projects that cannot justify the overhead of a dedicated support organisation, the administrative work often falls on the project manager’s shoulders.
    
    - This can lead to a negative reaction against "bureaucracy" when the project manager is asked to spend a significant amount of time producing standard documentation.
    
    - Some organisations may have central functions (e.g., for planning, finance, procurement) that can provide ad-hoc assistance in these situations.

> [!CAUTION]  
> With the support of the sponsor, the project manager of a small, stand-alone project should seek as much help with day-to-day administration as possible. Taking shortcuts in the administration of even the smallest project is a frequent cause of failure.

- Beyond day-to-day administration, project managers should be provided with broader types of support from the organisation's governance infrastructure. This includes:
    
    - Continuing Professional Development (CPD) through communities of practice.
    
    - Career advice and development.
    
    - Managing the transition between one project and the next.

### Programme and Large Project Support

- Programmes and large, complex projects are typically large enough to carry the overhead of a dedicated support function. They may also have access to a central, corporate support function.

- A programme support function must have the expertise to cover the additional services required at the programme level. These typically include supporting:
    
    - **Change Management**
    
    - **Benefits Management**
    
    - **Project Interfaces** and interdependencies.

- The programme management team must decide how to structure the support organisation across the programme. For example:
    
    - Will one central support function serve the programme and all its component projects?
    
    - Or will some (or all) component projects have their own separate project support functions?

### Portfolio Support

- The portfolio support function operates at the highest level, often covering multiple departments or the entire organisation.

- In an organisation with a single, enterprise-wide portfolio, the **portfolio support office and the governance infrastructure are effectively the same thing**.

- This structure is often referred to as a **PMO (Project Management Office)** and is a permanent organisational structure.

- The specific remit of the PMO is decided by whether the portfolio is a **standard portfolio** (focusing on efficiency and consistency) or a **structured portfolio** (focusing on delivering strategic objectives).

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the four general goals of a support function?
    - **A:** 1. Provide administrative support, 2. Support governance, 3. Provide specialist technical support, and 4. Conduct assurance.

- **Q:** What is the major risk for a small, stand-alone project manager regarding support?
    - **A:** The administrative workload falls on them, leading to the temptation to take shortcuts in administration, which is a common cause of project failure.

- **Q:** What are three specialist services a programme support function typically provides that a simple project support function might not?
    - **A:** Support for change management, benefits management, and managing project interfaces/interdependencies.

- **Q:** What is the difference between a temporary and a permanent support office?
    - **A:** A **temporary** office supports a specific project or programme and is disbanded when it ends. A **permanent** office is part of the organisation's structure, providing ongoing support and focusing on improving overall P3M capability.

- **Q:** In an organisation with a single, enterprise-wide portfolio, what is the portfolio support office often called and what is its nature?
    - **A:** It is often called a **PMO (Project Management Office)**, and it is a permanent organisational structure that is effectively the same as the P3 governance infrastructure.
