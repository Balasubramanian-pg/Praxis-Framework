# Comprehensive Study Notes: P3 Management Documentation

## Introduction to Documentation Categories

- In the Praxis Framework, P3 management documents are organised into three main categories. This structure helps to clarify the purpose and content of each type of documentation.

---

## The Three Categories of Documents

### 1. Governance Documents

- **Purpose**: These documents set out the **policies, standards, and guidelines** for the _management_ of the work. They are the "rulebooks" that define _how_ the project, programme, or portfolio will be governed and controlled.

- **Source**: Some of these documents may be specialist documents provided by the host organisation, a client, or a regulatory body.

- **Praxis Focus**: The Praxis Framework specifically deals with the **management plans** (e.g., risk management plan, scope management plan, finance management plan) that detail how each element of P3 management will be performed.

### 2. Scope Documents

- **Purpose**: These documents describe the **objectives** of the work.

- **Content**: They define the outputs, outcomes, and benefits that the project, programme, or portfolio is intended to deliver.

- **Examples**: Specification, Blueprint, Benefits Map, Product Breakdown Structure.

### 3. Delivery Documents

- **Purpose**: This is the largest and most diverse group of documents. They describe the specifics of _performing_ the work and support the day-to-day management processes and procedures.

- **Content**: They describe **what** needs to be done, **when** it will be done, and by **whom**.

- **Examples**: Schedules, Risk Register, Change Log, Progress Reports, Work Packages.

## How Praxis Organises Documentation

- As well as being listed in a dedicated "Documentation" section, all documents in the Praxis Framework are **cross-referenced** to provide a fully integrated view.

- They are aligned with both the topics from the **Knowledge** section and the processes from the **Method** section.

> [!NOTE]  
> This cross-referencing is a key feature that helps users understand the context of each document. It shows both the functional area a document belongs to and the point in the life cycle where it is created or used.
> 
> **Example**:
> 
> - The **Risk Management Plan** is a governance document.
> 
> - It appears in the resource page for the **Risk Management function** (its Knowledge area).
> 
> - It also appears in the resource page for the **Definition Process** (the Method process where it is first created in detail).
