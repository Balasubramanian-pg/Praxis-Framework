# Comprehensive Study Notes: Project, Programme, and Portfolio Management (P3M)

## General Principles of P3 Management

- **Definition**: Project, Programme, and Portfolio Management (P3M) is the application of methods, procedures, techniques, and competence to achieve a set of defined objectives.

### Goals of P3 Management

- The two primary goals of P3 management are to:
    
    1. Deliver the required objectives to stakeholders in a **planned and controlled manner**.
    
    2. Govern and manage the processes that deliver these objectives **effectively and efficiently**.

### Benefits of Effective P3 Management

- A significant investment in effective P3 management provides benefits to both the host organisation and the individuals involved in the work. These benefits include:
    
    - Increasing the likelihood of **achieving the desired results**.
    
    - Ensuring the **effective and efficient use** of resources.
    
    - Satisfying the needs of different and often competing **stakeholders**.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> A consistent approach to P3 management, executed by competent resources, is the central pillar for developing organisational capability maturity. A mature organisation is one that can successfully deliver its objectives on a regular and predictable basis.

## Project and Programme Management

- Projects and programmes share many fundamental similarities. Both are:
    
    - **Unique**: They are one-off undertakings.
    
    - **Transient**: They have a defined start and end.
    
    - **Objective-driven**: They are undertaken to achieve a specific set of stated objectives.

- **The Key Distinction**: The primary difference between a project and a programme is the need to accommodate different degrees of **complexity of scope**. The differences between project management and programme management practices mirror this distinction.

### Central Elements of Both Project and Programme Management

- Having a clear reason why the work is necessary (the "why").

- Capturing requirements, specifying objectives, and estimating resources and timescales.

- Preparing a **business case** to demonstrate that the work is desirable, achievable, and viable.

- Securing funding for the work.

- Developing and implementing comprehensive management plans.

- Leading and motivating the management and delivery teams.

- Monitoring and controlling key constraints: scope, schedule, finance, risk, and resources.

- Maintaining good relationships with all stakeholders.

- Closing the project or programme in a controlled and orderly manner when appropriate.

### Characteristics Typical of Programme Management (Due to Scope Complexity)

- While a complex project may have some of these elements, they are the defining characteristics of programme management.

- **Project Co-ordination**:
    - Actively identifying, initiating, accelerating, decelerating, redefining, and terminating the component projects within the programme to ensure alignment with the overall goal.

- **Managing Interdependencies**:
    - Managing the complex relationships and dependencies _between_ projects, and between the projects and the associated change management activities.

- **Transformation**:
    - The process of taking the outputs delivered by the projects and actively managing the change required within business-as-usual operations so that these outputs are embedded and deliver the desired outcomes.

- **Benefits Management**:
    - The entire lifecycle of benefits, including defining, quantifying, measuring, and monitoring them to ensure the programme delivers the value promised in the business case.

### Key Roles and Competencies

- **Sponsor and Manager**:
    
    - They share responsibility for the elements above.
    
    - The **sponsor** is ultimately **accountable** for the achievement of the business case.
    
    - The **manager** (Project or Programme Manager) is responsible for the **day-to-day running** of the work.

- **Managerial Competence**:
    
    - A manager needs to be competent in six key aspects of delivery:
        
        1. Scope Management
        
        2. Schedule Management
        
        3. Finance Management
        
        4. Risk Management
        
        5. Resource Management
        
        6. Change Management (if relevant to the scope)
    
    - Crucially, competence in interpersonal skills such as **leadership, influencing, communication, and conflict management** is also vitally important for success.

- **Business Change Manager**:
    - Where the scope includes benefits that require organisational change, Business Change Managers (BCMs) are responsible for ensuring a successful transition from the old way of working to the new and for the subsequent benefits realisation.

## Portfolio Management

- Portfolio management operates at a higher level than project or programme management, focusing on the strategic alignment and coordination of multiple initiatives.

### Standard Portfolio Management

- **Focus**: A standard portfolio contains projects and/or programmes with largely **independent objectives**. The primary focus of management is on increasing the **effectiveness and efficiency** of how this work is delivered across the organisation.

- **Core Components**:
    
    - **Establishing an Infrastructure**: Creating a support structure (e.g., a PMO) to help projects and programmes succeed.
    
    - **Defining Consistent Processes**: Creating and mandating the use of common management procedures and processes to be used across all work.
    
    - **Co-ordinating Limited Resources**: Managing the overall demand for resources against the available supply and optimising their allocation across the portfolio.

### Structured Portfolio Management

- **Focus**: A structured portfolio coordinates projects and programmes that collectively work together to realise the host organisation’s **strategic objectives**. Its goal is to balance the implementation of change with the maintenance of business-as-usual, all while optimising the return on investment.

- It includes all the components of standard portfolio management, plus several additional strategic elements.

- **Additional Core Elements**:
    
    - **Maintaining Strategic Alignment**: Continuously reviewing and maintaining a balanced portfolio that is aligned with the organisation's strategic objectives, even as those objectives or external conditions change.
    
    - **Improving Delivery via Portfolio-wide View**: Using a high-level perspective to manage and coordinate risk, resources, dependencies, and schedules across the entire portfolio.
    
    - **Co-ordinating Change Capacity**: Understanding the organisation's ability to absorb change and coordinating the portfolio to ensure that the cumulative impact of all projects and programmes does not overwhelm the business.
    
    - **Reducing Costs and Redundancy**: Identifying and removing overlapping or poorly performing projects and programmes to free up investment for more valuable initiatives.

> [!NOTE]  
> The management of a structured portfolio is a dynamic and continuous process. It must constantly review the balance of investment and benefit, creating new projects and programmes and closing existing ones as necessary to maintain strategic alignment.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is P3M?
    - **A:** Project, Programme, and Portfolio Management. It is the application of methods, procedures, techniques, and competence to achieve a set of defined objectives.

- **Q:** What is the primary factor that distinguishes a project from a programme?
    - **A:** The complexity of the scope. Programmes are used to manage a higher complexity of scope involving multiple projects and change management to deliver benefits.

- **Q:** What are the four key activities typical of programme management that are not central to project management?
    - **A:** 1. Project co-ordination, 2. Managing interdependencies, 3. Transformation, and 4. Benefits management.

- **Q:** Who is ultimately accountable for the achievement of a project or programme's business case?
    - **A:** The sponsor.

- **Q:** What is the main difference between a Standard Portfolio and a Structured Portfolio?
    - **A:** A **Standard Portfolio** focuses on managing independent projects efficiently and effectively. A **Structured Portfolio** focuses on managing interdependent projects and programmes to achieve the organisation's strategic objectives.
