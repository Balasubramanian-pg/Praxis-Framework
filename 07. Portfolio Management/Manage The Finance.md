# Manage The Finance

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Manage Finance Competency

## Purpose of the Competency

- The purpose of this competency is to demonstrate the ability to achieve the goals of financial management. These goals are to:
    
    - Estimate the **cost** of achieving the objectives.
    
    - Assess the financial **viability** of achieving the objectives.
    
    - **Secure funds** and manage their release throughout the life cycle.
    
    - Set up and run appropriate **financial systems**.
    
    - **Monitor and control** expenditure against the budget.

---

## Performance Criteria

- An individual must be able to demonstrate the ability to perform the following actions:

- **Plan and initiate financial management**
    
    - This involves defining the approach, procedures, systems, and standards that will be used for all financial activities, including estimating, budgeting, funding, and cost control.
    
    - The output is typically a **finance management plan**.

- **Ensure the cost of the work is understood**
    
    - This is the practical application of cost estimating.
    
    - It involves working with the team to produce realistic cost estimates for all aspects of the work, including base costs, contingency for known risks, and an allowance for management reserve.

- **Identify the best means of funding the work**
    
    - This is the practical application of the funding function.
    
    - It involves identifying potential funding sources (internal or external), securing commitment from the fundholders, and establishing the mechanism for the drawdown of funds throughout the life cycle.

- **Apply principles of financial and management accounting**
    
    - This is the core control activity.
    
    - It involves setting up and managing systems to track different types of costs (committed, accrued, actual), forecasting future expenditure, and controlling costs against the approved budget.

- **Maintain financial documentation**
    - This involves creating and maintaining all the key financial documents, including:
        
        - Cost estimates.
        
        - The formal budget.
        
        - Cash flow forecasts.
        
        - Cost reports and variance analyses.
        
        - The financial sections of the business case.

- **Assure the quality of financial management**
    
    - This involves ensuring that the agreed-upon procedures for financial management are being followed correctly.
    
    - It includes checking that estimates are sound, budgets are properly approved, and costs are being tracked and controlled in accordance with the finance management plan.

> [NOTE]  
> This competency summarises several others (Investment Appraisal, Funding, Budgeting and Cost Control) and should be adjusted to fit the context. Managing finance in a P3 environment inevitably links to, and may overlap with, corporate finance systems. When applying this competency, it is crucial to reflect what is within the authority of the P3 organisation versus what is controlled by the host organisation’s financial systems.

## Knowledge and Understanding

- An individual needs to know and understand the following principles and concepts:

- **The principles and goals of financial management**
    - Understanding the overall purpose of financial management is to estimate costs, secure funds, and control expenditure to ensure the work remains viable.

- **Responsibilities for financial management**
    - Knowing who is responsible for what, including the role of the sponsor (secures funding, owns the business case), the P3 manager (manages the budget within tolerances), and corporate finance (provides systems and expertise).

- **The context of the work and its impact on financial management**
    - Understanding how factors like complexity, scale, and the contractual environment (e.g., a client-contractor relationship) will impact financial management. This includes knowing when simple spreadsheets are sufficient versus when dedicated financial systems are required.

- **A procedure for managing finance**
    - Understanding the typical flow from estimating costs, to creating a budget, to securing funds, and then to controlling costs against that budget.

- **The purpose and content of financial management documentation**
    - Knowing the purpose of key documents like the business case, the budget, the cash flow forecast, and cost reports.

- **The principles of investment appraisal**
    
    - Understanding the key techniques used to assess the financial viability of an investment.
    
    - This includes knowing what **Payback**, **Accounting Rate of Return (ARR)**, **Net Present Value (NPV)**, and **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)** are and when they are used.

- **Principles of funding**
    - Understanding the different sources of funding (internal vs. external) and the mechanisms for securing and managing the release of funds throughout the life cycle.

- **Principles of budgeting and cost control**
    
    - Understanding how to construct a budget, including the three main components: **base cost estimate**, **contingency reserve**, and **management reserve**.
    
    - Knowing how to track different types of costs (committed, accrued, actual) and how to apply controls and tolerances.
    
    - Being aware of more sophisticated control techniques like **Earned Value Management (EVM)** where appropriate.

- **How assurance applies to financial management**
    - Understanding how to audit and review the financial management function to ensure that policies are being followed, costs are being reported accurately, and the work remains financially viable.
