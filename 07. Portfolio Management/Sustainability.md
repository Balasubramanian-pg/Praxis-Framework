# Comprehensive Study Notes: Sustainability in P3 Management

## General Principles of Sustainability

- Sustainability is a concept of increasing importance in all aspects of business and society.

- Since much of the modern world is created and changed through portfolios of projects and programmes, it is vital that the principles of sustainability are actively promoted through P3 management.

- The P3 management profession is a primary agent for bringing about change and therefore has a significant role to play in building and maintaining sustainability.

### The Goals of Sustainability in P3M

- In the context of project, programme, and portfolio management, the goals of sustainability are to:
    
    - Develop a **sustainability culture** within the management team, delivery team, and the wider stakeholder community.
    
    - Build sustainability into the **end product(s)** of the work (the outputs, outcomes, and benefits).
    
    - Manage the **delivery work** itself with a consistent focus on sustainability.

### The Two Perspectives of Sustainability

- Sustainability in P3 management must be viewed from two distinct but interconnected perspectives:
    
    1. **Sustainability of the Objectives**:
        
        - This perspective focuses on the outputs, outcomes, and benefits that the project or programme is created to deliver.
        
        - It requires a long-term view that extends well beyond the life of the project or programme, continuing until any outputs are eventually decommissioned.
        
        - This aspect of sustainability must be designed and built into the work during the early life cycle phases, where options are considered and designs are agreed upon.
    
    2. **Sustainability in the Delivery Process**:
        
        - This perspective focuses on _how_ the outputs, outcomes, and benefits are achieved.
        
        - Project and programme management practices should incorporate sustainability principles throughout the entire delivery life cycle.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Both of these perspectives are heavily reliant on establishing an overarching culture of sustainability. While project and programme teams can influence the culture within their temporary organisations, this will be difficult to achieve and maintain unless it exists within a supportive wider organisational culture.

## Integrating Sustainability into the P3 Life Cycle

### The Early Phases: Identification and Definition

- The early phases of a project or programme life cycle are the most critical for embedding sustainability into the objectives of the work.

- **Analysis of Options and the Triple Bottom Line (TBL)**:
    
    - During the identification phase, different options for achieving the desired goals will be considered for inclusion in the outline business case.
    
    - The analysis of these options should follow the principles of the **Triple Bottom Line (TBL)**.
    
    - The TBL values benefits not only in traditional **financial** terms but also considers **social** and **environmental** effects.
    
    - When options are compared for approval, the decision-making process must take all three TBL aspects into account.

- **Balancing TBL with the Triple Constraint**:
    
    - Finding the right balance between the TBL components (financial, social, environmental) echoes the more conventional project management challenge of balancing the triple constraint (time, cost, scope).
    
    - Each component of the TBL will contribute to and influence the balance of time, cost, and scope for the project.

- **Stakeholder Communication and Analysis Techniques**:
    
    - Effective communication with the stakeholder community is essential to find the optimum balance and navigate the inevitable resistance that may be encountered.
    
    - Techniques such as **systems thinking** should be used to take a holistic view of the outputs and their long-term operation.
    
    - An **environmental impact analysis** should consider the impact of the outputs across their full product life cycle, all the way to decommissioning.
    
    - The **total cost of ownership** should be considered, not just the initial cost of development.

- **Establishing the Sustainability Culture**:
    - The early phases are also crucial for establishing a sustainability culture for the rest of the life cycle. The identification and definition teams must establish and communicate the advantages of a sustainable approach, which may include:
        
        - Reputational and competitive advantage in a market sector.
        
        - Significant cost savings through the better use of resources.
        
        - Ensuring compliance with current and future regulations.
        
        - Driving innovation in methods, materials, and technology.
        
        - Providing access to specific grants and funding sources that favour sustainable initiatives.

### The Delivery Phase

- Once the project or programme is authorised for delivery, the focus of sustainable practices shifts to _how_ the outputs are developed.

- **Planning and Reporting**:
    
    - Specific sustainability **metrics** should be identified so that performance can be measured and included in both internal and external reporting.
    
    - If appropriate for the context of the work, these metrics, along with related policies and procedures, will be defined in a dedicated **sustainability management plan**.

- **Integrating into P3 Functions**:
    - All relevant management functions should be reviewed and adapted to take sustainability into account. Key functions include:
        
        - **Risk Management**: Identifying and managing risks related to social and environmental impacts.
        
        - **Stakeholder Management**: Engaging with stakeholders specifically on sustainability concerns and expectations.
        
        - **Procurement**: Giving specific attention to **green and ethical procurement** practices in the supply chain.
        
        - **Assurance**: Including sustainability criteria in assurance reviews to ensure plans are being followed.

- **Waste Reduction**:
    - A key practice during delivery is the active reduction of waste, which not only provides environmental benefits but also has obvious and direct cost benefits.

### The Closing Phase

- Sustainability remains a focus even as the project or programme winds down.

- **Resource Management**:
    - The closing team should ensure that resources procured for the project (e.g., equipment, materials) are **recycled or repurposed** wherever possible.

- **Transition to Operation**:
    
    - The transition of the output from the development team to the operational owner is a critical point.
    
    - The team must ensure that the planned sustainable operational practices are in place and understood by the new owner to ensure the long-term sustainability goals are met.
