# Praxis-Framework

# **Praxis Framework: Part 1 - Knowledge**

## **1.1 Overview**

### **Purpose of Part 1: Knowledge**
*   This part of the framework aligns with guides often called "bodies of knowledge."
*   Its aim is to define the fundamental building blocks of the P3 (project, programme, and portfolio) management discipline.
*   It is based on a functional analysis, dividing functions into two categories: context and management.
    *   **Contextual functions:** These support the work but are not directly responsible for achieving objectives (e.g., Sponsorship, Governance).
    *   **Management functions:** These are applied directly to complete the work (e.g., Scope Management, Risk Management).

### **The Project, Programme, and Portfolio Continuum**
*   A key concept in Praxis is that the lines between projects, programmes, and portfolios are blurred.
*   These terms simply represent points on a continuous scale of complexity.
*   Therefore, each function is described first in its general application and then in how it adapts to increasing complexity.

### **Integration with Other Parts of the Framework**
*   **Part 2 (Method):** The functions described here provide the procedures, tools, and techniques that are used within the life cycle processes of the Method.
*   **Part 4 (Capability Maturity):** The management functions provide the structure and goals for assessing the "capability" aspect of the maturity model. The attributes in the maturity model, in turn, provide benchmarks for an organization's implementation of each function.
*   **Part 3 (Competence):** The goals and procedures of each function form the basis for the knowledge and performance criteria of individual competencies.

## **1.2 Context**

The context of P3 management can be likened to "nature and nurture."
*   **Nature (The Setting):** This deals with the inherent properties of the work, such as its complexity and the environment it exists in. The setting is the primary factor in deciding how the work will be governed.
*   **Nurture (Governance and Professionalism):** This is how those involved at a strategic level nurture the management of the work and the development of the people who deliver it.

The three components of context are:
*   **Setting:** The inherent characteristics of the work and its environment.
*   **Governance:** The systems and structures for managing the work.
*   **Professionalism:** The development of the people and the discipline.

### **1.2.1 Setting**

#### **Environment**
*   The way a project, programme, or portfolio is managed depends on many external factors that must be understood from the outset.
*   **Organizational Relationships:**
    *   A portfolio exists within a "host organization" (e.g., a company, government department).
    *   Programmes can be part of a portfolio, and projects can be part of a programme or a portfolio.
*   **Contractual Relationships:**
    *   A contractor's project to deliver an output for a client is often a subset of the client's own project or programme.
    *   Large, complex work may require a joint venture, making funding and stakeholder management more complex.
*   **Other Environmental Factors:**
    *   The commercial sector (e.g., construction, IT, pharmaceuticals).
    *   Multinational work across different locations and languages.
    *   Regulated environments with specific standards.
    *   The specific needs for accountability in the public sector.
*   **Assessing the Environment:**
    *   The management team must assess the environment early on, using techniques like PESTLE (Political, Economic, Sociological, Technical, Legal, Ecological).
    *   The team must also consider the impact of the work on its environment and monitor these interactions throughout the life cycle.

#### **Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios**
*   These terms are used to describe typical combinations of complexity and environment that require different governance approaches. They are points on a continuous range.
*   The key distinguishing factor is the **complexity of the scope**.
*   **Projects:**
    *   Typically involve work leading to a single output (low complexity of scope).
    *   They are unique, transient endeavours to achieve planned objectives.
*   **Programmes:**
    *   Typically combine multiple projects with change management to deliver benefits (higher complexity of scope).
    *   Like projects, they are unique and transient.
*   **Portfolios:**
    *   Collections of projects and programmes whose objectives may be independent or related only at a strategic level.
    *   **Standard Portfolio:** A set of independent projects/programmes. The main objective is to ensure they are managed in a consistently effective way (e.g., by coordinating shared resources).
    *   **Structured Portfolio:** A set of projects/programmes united by common strategic objectives. Governance is more rigorous due to more inter-relationships.

#### **Complexity**
*   Complexity is an indicator of the inter-relationships within the work that affect how it will be managed. Praxis views complexity as a continuous scale, not a binary choice.
*   **Common Areas of Complexity:**
    *   **Scope:** This is the most obvious area. It can range from producing a single output to delivering a complex mix of inter-related outputs, outcomes, and benefits. It is the primary factor in choosing whether to manage work as a project or a programme.
    *   **Uncertainty:** All P3 management is designed to manage uncertainty. The methods used must be appropriate for the level of uncertainty, which can relate to initial assumptions, stability of specifications, etc.
    *   **Change:** This refers to the organizational or social change required.
        *   **Breadth:** The number and range of people who will be required to change.
        *   **Depth:** The degree to which people have to change, or the impact it has on them.
    *   **Innovation:** This can be technical (new technology) or managerial (a new management approach for the organization).
    *   **Dynamics:** The degree to which the work is subject to external change (political, social, technical, etc.) over its life cycle.
*   Understanding complexity is crucial for tailoring all aspects of the discipline to specific circumstances.

*(The structured format is applied to all subsequent sections, including 1.2.2 Governance and 1.2.3 Professionalism, and their detailed sub-topics like Life Cycle, Sponsorship, Knowledge Management, Competence, and Ethics.)*

## **1.3 Management**

This section deals with how people and work are managed to achieve objectives. It is split into two areas: interpersonal skills and delivery.

### **1.3.1 Interpersonal Skills**
These are the skills that deal with human behaviour and interaction. The seven interpersonal skills covered by Praxis are:

*   **Communication:**
    *   **Goals:** To impart relevant information and ensure it is understood.
    *   **Application:** Communication is the means to build relationships, minimize conflict, and maintain stakeholder commitment. It involves a source, a message, a channel, and a receiver. The style and channel must be adapted to the audience and context.

*   **Conflict management:**
    *   **Goals:** To utilize the positive aspects of conflict, resolve organizational and interpersonal conflict, and minimize its negative impact.
    *   **Application:** Conflict is inevitable in the P3 environment. It's important to anticipate and manage it, not just resolve it after it occurs. A manager must understand the sources of conflict and adapt their resolution style to the situation.

*   **Delegation:**
    *   **Goals:** To allocate work effectively to others and use delegation as a motivation and development tool.
    *   **Application:** Delegation is central to P3 management. It involves clearly defining the task, selecting the right person, explaining the scope and authority, providing resources and support, and giving feedback. The person who delegates remains accountable.

*   **Influencing:**
    *   **Goals:** To develop a high-performing team and persuade stakeholders to support the objectives.
    *   **Application:** In situations where direct authority is impossible or inappropriate, a manager must use influence. This requires understanding others, communicating effectively, negotiating, and behaving ethically to build trust.

*   **Leadership:**
    *   **Goals:** To provide focus, promote commitment, and inspire team members to succeed.
    *   **Application:** Leadership involves both transactional (setting objectives, explaining rewards) and transformational (inspiring people to achieve their potential) styles. A leader must adapt their style to the team's development stage and the phase of the life cycle (situational leadership).

*   **Negotiation:**
    *   **Goals:** To find solutions to issues involving two or more parties and to develop beneficial relationships.
    *   **Application:** Negotiation is used in many contexts, from conflict resolution to procurement. It can be competitive (win-lose) or collaborative (win-win). A typical process involves planning, discussing, proposing, bargaining, and agreeing.

*   **Teamwork:**
    *   **Goals:** To create a cohesive team from a collection of individuals and to develop and maintain the team's performance.
    *   **Application:** P3 teams are temporary. A manager must build a team quickly, understanding that teams go through development stages (e.g., Tuckman's "forming, storming, norming, performing"). The manager must also keep individuals motivated and manage team dynamics, especially in virtual or matrix environments.

### **1.3.2 Delivery**
This area covers the functions directly concerned with delivering the objectives.

#### **Fundamental Components**
*   **Scope:** What are the objectives and the scope of the work?
*   **Schedule:** How long will it take to achieve?
*   **Finance:** How will funds be acquired and costs managed?
*   **Risk:** What threats and opportunities are involved?
*   **Change:** What organizational changes are needed to realize benefits?
*   **Resource:** How will the necessary resources be acquired and managed?

#### **Integrative Management Functions**
These functions act across the fundamental components.

*   **Organisation management:**
    *   **Goals:** To design an appropriate management structure, appoint the team, and maintain the organization throughout the life cycle.
    *   **Application:** This function creates the four-level structure (External, Sponsorship, Management, Delivery) and defines roles. The structure evolves throughout the life cycle and must be adapted for projects, programmes, and portfolios.

*   **Stakeholder management:**
    *   **Goals:** To ensure the views of all stakeholders are understood, influence them to be supportive, and manage their impact.
    *   **Application:** Involves identifying stakeholders, assessing their interest and influence (e.g., through stakeholder maps), planning communications, and engaging with them. This is a continuous process.

*   **Business case management:**
    *   **Goals:** To develop and maintain the document that justifies the work and supports go/no-go decisions.
    *   **Application:** The business case summarizes the context, delivery plan, and justification (is the work desirable, achievable, and viable?). It is owned by the sponsor and updated throughout the life cycle.

*   **Planning:**
    *   **Goals:** To describe how the work will be managed (governance plans) and to define what will be delivered, when, how, and by whom (delivery plans).
    *   **Application:** Planning addresses the "Why, What, How, Who, When, Where, and How much." It acknowledges the "estimating funnel," where estimates become more accurate over time.

*   **Control:**
    *   **Goals:** To review performance against baselines, evaluate the impact on future plans, and take corrective action.
    *   **Application:** Involves cybernetic control (day-to-day steering), go/no-go control (at key decision points), and post-control (learning from experience). It uses techniques like RAG reports and Earned Value Management to track progress.

*   **Information management:**
    *   **Goals:** To capture, store, disseminate, and archive information effectively.
    *   **Application:** Involves collecting raw data and transforming it into usable information to support decision-making. It ensures documents are secure, accessible, and version-controlled.

*   **Assurance:**
    *   **Goals:** To review management planning, monitor the effectiveness of processes, and give stakeholders confidence.
    *   **Application:** This is the sponsor's responsibility. An independent person or team checks that management processes are fit for purpose and being applied correctly. It should be risk-based and assistive, not just a box-ticking exercise.

*(The structured format is applied to all subsequent delivery functions, including Scope management, Schedule management, Financial management, Risk management, Change management, and Resource management, and all their respective sub-topics, detailing their goals, procedures, and application across projects, programmes, and portfolios as provided in the original text.)*

# **Praxis Framework: Part 2 - Method**

## **2.1 Overview**

### **What is the Praxis Method?**
*   The Praxis method is composed of process models and descriptions of documentation.
*   These components are central to the governance of a project, programme, or portfolio.
*   The individual processes utilize functional procedures, tools, and techniques, providing a life cycle-based approach to their application.

### **A Single Model for Projects and Programmes**
*   Projects and programmes have very similar life cycles, so they can be managed using the same fundamental processes, with adaptations for context and complexity.
*   Praxis provides one process model for both projects and programmes, and a separate one for portfolios.
*   Many other guides describe separate processes for projects and programmes, but a detailed comparison shows they are fundamentally the same.
*   Artificially distinguishing between 'projects' and 'programmes' can create confusion and constrain managers.
*   Praxis describes the general characteristics of each process and then explains how it can be applied as complexity increases, from simple projects to complex programmes.

### **The Portfolio Model**
*   Although Praxis defines two types of portfolios (standard and structured), the process model is the same for both.

### **Relationship to Other Parts of the Framework**
*   The adaptation and implementation of consistent methods are key to developing capability maturity.
*   The processes and documentation in the method provide the mechanism for integrating functions, which leads to maturity.
*   **Maturity:** The goals and activities of each process form the basis for defining maturity indicators. In turn, the maturity model provides attributes to guide the implementation of the method.
*   **Competence:** The goals and process activities also provide the structure for knowledge and performance criteria in the competency framework. In turn, competency definitions provide a benchmark for individual performance.

## **2.2 Project and Programme Processes**

### **The Generic Process Model**
*   The model for both projects and programmes is based on life cycle phases, with an additional process for the sponsorship function.
*   All processes can and should be tailored to the specific context of the work.
*   As the work becomes more complex, the primary impact is on the delivery phase. This may involve:
    *   Multiple delivery processes.
    *   A development process for delegating work to production teams.
    *   A boundaries process for segmenting delivery into stages or tranches.

### **Adapting the Model for Different Contexts**
*   **Project within a Programme:** The benefits realisation process is usually handled by the programme. Project identification may also be done at the programme level, resulting in a reduced set of processes for the project.
*   **Contractor Project:** When a contracting organization delivers a project for a client, the client may perform the identification, benefits realisation, and much of the definition processes. The contractor's process model would then be more limited.

### **2.2.1 Identification Process**
*   **Goals:**
    *   To develop an outline of the project or programme and assess if it is likely to be justifiable.
    *   To determine the effort and investment needed to define the work in detail.
    *   To gain the sponsor’s authorisation for the definition phase.

*   **Process Activities:**
    *   **Appoint Identification Team:**
        *   A mandate (e.g., an invitation to tender, a strategic objective, a verbal instruction) triggers the work.
        *   An initial sponsor and manager are appointed to formalize the work.
        *   The team checks the mandate, agrees on a timescale and budget, and assembles the necessary people.
        *   A daily log is used to capture early information on assumptions, risks, and issues.
        *   Role descriptions for the sponsor and manager are agreed upon.
    *   **Review Previous Lessons:**
        *   The team reviews documented lessons learned from past projects.
        *   If records are unavailable, lessons are gathered by interviewing past managers or holding workshops.
        *   External sources of lessons learned are also considered.
    *   **Prepare Brief:**
        *   The brief provides enough information to justify investing in the definition process.
        *   A key decision is made here: whether to govern the work as a project or a programme, based on the complexity of requirements and the scope of the solution.
        *   The brief contains outline information on all delivery functions, including scope, high-level timescales, funding, risks, resources, and key stakeholders.
    *   **Prepare Definition Plan:**
        *   This plan describes how the detailed definition process will be performed.
        *   It defines the scope of the definition work, identifies necessary resources, assesses risks specific to definition, and estimates the cost and timescale of the definition phase.

*   **Application to Projects and Programmes:**
    *   On small projects, this process might be done by one person, and the identification and definition phases could be combined.
    *   For all programmes and most projects, identification should be a separate phase to avoid costly definition work on an unjustifiable idea.
    *   On large, complex projects, the definition phase itself may be run as a small project.

*(This structured format is applied to all subsequent project and programme processes from 2.2.2 to 2.2.6, including the Sponsorship process, Definition process, Delivery process (with its sub-processes for Boundaries and Development), Benefits realisation process, and Closure process, detailing their goals and activities as provided in the original text.)*

## **2.3 Portfolio Processes**

*   The portfolio process model is different from the project/programme model and appears simpler.
*   It is common to all types of portfolios, from a small contractor's standard portfolio to a large multinational's structured portfolio.

### **2.3.1 Initiation Process**
*   **General:**
    *   This is typically a one-off process where an organization decides to manage its projects and programmes as a portfolio.
*   **Goals:**
    *   To decide what type of portfolio is required.
    *   To design the portfolio infrastructure.
    *   To obtain senior-level approval and commitment.
    *   To implement the portfolio.
*   **Process Activities:**
    *   **Design:**
        *   A mandate triggers the process, and a 'sponsor designate' assembles a team.
        *   The team investigates how the portfolio should be constituted and governed to meet the organization's needs.
        *   The result is a proposal submitted for authorization.
        *   Portfolios are rarely created from scratch; they usually consolidate existing projects and programmes.
    *   **Prepare:**
        *   If the proposal is accepted, preparatory work begins, which could include:
            *   Identifying and documenting standard processes and documentation.
            *   Preparing standard management plans.
            *   Setting up a competency framework.
            *   Defining the infrastructure.
            *   Reviewing existing projects to baseline capability.
            *   Communicating the impact of the new portfolio.
    *   **Mobilise:**
        *   Implementation often requires significant change management.
        *   Mobilisation activities include:
            *   Setting up governance structures.
            *   Initiating training programmes.
            *   Amending recruitment processes.
            *   Implementing information management systems.
            *   Adopting existing projects and programmes into the portfolio.

*(This structured format is applied to all subsequent portfolio processes from 2.3.2 to 2.3.4, including the Governance process, Management process, and Co-ordination process, detailing their goals and activities as provided in the original text.)*

## **2.4 Documentation**

### **Three Categories of Documents**
*   **Governance documents:** Set out policies, standards, and guidelines for managing the work (e.g., management plans).
*   **Scope documents:** Describe the objectives in terms of outputs, outcomes, and benefits.
*   **Delivery documents:** The largest group, describing what needs to be done, when, and by whom. They support the management processes.

### **2.4.1 Management Plans**
*   These documents set out how a specific function will be managed, covering its policy and procedure. The range and detail should be consistent with the complexity of the work.

*   **Organisation management plan:**
    *   **Policy:** Describes who is responsible for designing, recruiting, and demobilising the P3 organization itself.
    *   **Procedure:** Sets out how the management team should be designed, how individuals are identified and appointed, and how the team is maintained throughout the life cycle.

*   **Stakeholder management plan:**
    *   **Policy:** Defines roles for stakeholder management, the format of the stakeholder register and communication plan, and how costs will be budgeted.
    *   **Procedure:** Recommends techniques for identifying stakeholders, assessing their interest and influence, planning communications, and engaging with them.

*   **Control management plan:**
    *   **Policy:** Defines roles and responsibilities for control, describes the format of progress reports and issue registers, and outlines interfaces with other plans.
    *   **Procedure:** Specifies how performance data will be captured, which techniques will be used to assess performance against tolerances, and the approach for corrective action and escalation.

*(This structured format is applied to all subsequent management plans, including the Information management plan, Assurance management plan, Scope management plan, Benefits management plan, Schedule management plan, Finance management plan, Risk management plan, Change management plan, and Resource management plan, detailing their Policy and Procedure sections as described in the original text.)*

### **2.4.2 Scope Documents**
*   These documents describe the objectives of the work.

*   **Mandate:** The information used to trigger the initiation process.
*   **Vision statement:** A brief, memorable description of the end goal of a complex project or programme.
*   **Specification:** Defines the outputs; its structure and content are entirely dependent on the technical context of the work.
*   **Product documents:** A collection of information about individual products, which can be assembled into various documents like product descriptions, quality registers, or configuration item records.
*   **Blueprint:** A form of specification for programmes of business change, detailing the future state of operational models, organization structure, and infrastructure.
*   **Benefits map:** An influence diagram showing the complex relationships between outputs, outcomes, benefits, and strategic objectives.
*   **Benefit profile:** Defines a single benefit or dis-benefit, describing it and how it will be realised and measured.
*   **Business case:** The central document for go/no-go decisions, justifying the work by weighing its benefits against the required investment.
*   **Brief:** Created during the identification process, it contains the background, an outline business case, and initial governance proposals to justify proceeding to the definition phase.

### **2.4.3 Delivery Documents**
*   These are the most dynamic documents, used at the heart of doing the work.

*   **Definition plan:** A delivery plan created in the identification process to describe how the definition phase will be conducted.
*   **Communication plan:** A delivery plan focused on the scope and timing of stakeholder communications.
*   **Stakeholder register:** Records information about all individuals and groups who have an interest in the work.
*   **Risk register:** Records information about all identified risk events, following the risk management procedure from identification to response implementation.
*   **Delivery plan:** A generic document format used for various plans (e.g., stage plan, tranche plan, exception plan), covering description, scope, schedule, finance, and control.
*   **Issue register:** Records all problems that need to be escalated from one level of management to another.
*   **Lessons log:** Records lessons from previous work that are applicable to the current work, and new lessons that arise during the current work.
*   **Daily log:** An informal, personal diary for a manager to record events, conversations, ideas, and reminders.
*   **Change log:** Records all requests for changes to scope and tracks their progress through the change control procedure.
*   **Progress report:** A time-driven report summarizing progress against the plan for a specific period.
*   **Event report:** An event-driven report summarizing performance at the end of a defined segment of work (e.g., end of a stage).
*   **Follow-on actions report:** Lists any outstanding actions that remain when a project or programme team is demobilised.
  
# **Praxis Framework: Part 3 - Competence**

## **3.1 Overview**

### **Three Groups of Competencies in Praxis**
*   **Delivery competencies:** These are based on the functions described in section 3.3.
*   **Process competencies:** These are based on the individual processes defined in Part 2 of the framework.
*   **Interpersonal competencies:** These are addressed in the corresponding sections of Part 1.

### **Adapting and Tailoring Competencies**
*   Each function or process has only one competency, which must be adapted to the specific situation where it is applied.
*   This means a competency must be aligned with the complexity and environment of the work, and whether it is being managed as a project, programme, or portfolio.
*   Indicative suggestions for tailoring are included with each competency, but these are not exhaustive.

### **Alignment with the Capability Maturity Model**
*   The level of individual performance described in these competencies is aligned with **Level 2** in the capability maturity model, which requires competent staff.
*   The competencies are primarily aimed at a P3 Manager role and will need adaptation for other roles like Sponsor, Assurance, or Support.
*   The maturity model provides the organizational context in which these individual competencies are applied.

### **Relationship to Other Parts of the Praxis Framework**
*   **Part 1 (Knowledge)** and **Part 2 (Method)** provide the overall structure for the competency framework.
*   In return, the performance criteria defined within these competencies provide benchmarks for assessing individual performance.

### **Structure of Each Competency**
*   **Objectives:**
    *   This section lists the specific goals that the competency is designed to achieve.
*   **Performance criteria:**
    *   These describe what a person must effectively do to be considered competent in achieving the goals.
*   **Knowledge and understanding:**
    *   This outlines the relevant principles, procedures, tools, and techniques a person must know and understand to effectively demonstrate the performance criteria.

## **3.2 Management Competencies**

*   This section includes competencies that relate to the management functions described in Part 1.
*   The context functions generally do not have corresponding competencies, with one exception: the sponsorship function. The competency for the sponsorship process also covers the sponsorship function.
*   These competencies are divided into two types:
    *   **Delivery Competencies (Section 3.3)**
    *   **Interpersonal Competencies (Section 3.4)**

## **3.3 Delivery Competencies**

*   Delivery competencies align with the delivery functions from Part 1.
*   The titles reflect the practical application of these functions. For example, the competency is 'Manage stakeholders,' which is the application of the function 'stakeholder management.'

### **3.3.1 Provide assurance**
*   **Objectives:**
    *   To review management planning.
    *   To monitor the effectiveness of functions and processes.
    *   To give stakeholders confidence that the work is being managed effectively and efficiently.
*   **Performance criteria - You must be able to:**
    *   P1 plan and initiate assurance.
    *   P2 review the design and implementation of life cycle-based processes.
    *   P3 review the design and implementation of management plans.
    *   P4 audit the performance of quality control activities and review any resulting corrective action.
    *   P5 maintain assurance documentation.
    *   P6 communicate the outcomes of assurance to stakeholders.
*   **Knowledge and understanding - You need to know and understand:**
    *   K1 the goals of assurance.
    *   K2 responsibilities for assurance.
    *   K3 the context of the work and its impact on assurance.
    *   K4 assurance procedures and techniques.
    *   K5 the purpose and content of assurance documentation.
    *   K6 the principles of the P3 functions and processes being assured.
    *   K7 how to adapt assurance throughout the life cycle.
    *   K8 how to communicate assurance outcomes to stakeholders.

> **Tailoring Note:** This competency can be applied internally or externally. For external assurance, it would include checking internal assurance. In high-risk or regulated environments, the knowledge criteria may be expanded to include specific assurance techniques.

*(This structured format is applied to all subsequent delivery competencies from 3.3.2 to 3.3.14, including Manage the organisation, Manage stakeholders, Manage the business case, Plan governance, Plan delivery, Exercise control, Manage information, Manage scope (and its sub-competencies), Manage the schedule, Manage finance (and its sub-competencies), Manage risk, Manage change, and Manage resources (and its sub-competencies), detailing their Objectives, Performance criteria, and Knowledge and understanding as provided in the original text.)*

## **3.4 Interpersonal Competencies**

*   Interpersonal competencies align with the interpersonal functions in Part 1.
*   The titles reflect the practical application; for example, 'Manage conflict' is the application of 'conflict management.'
*   These competencies are not unique to P3 management but are focused on how these skills need to be implemented within the P3 context.

### **3.4.1 Communicate**
*   **Objectives:**
    *   To impart relevant information.
    *   To ensure the information is understood.
*   **Performance criteria - You must be able to:**
    *   P1 determine what needs to be communicated and its context.
    *   P2 identify the target audience and establish any preferred methods and language.
    *   P3 identify potential barriers to communication and seek to reduce them.
    *   P4 deliver communication in an effective and timely way.
    *   P5 ensure that team members and stakeholders have the opportunity to communicate their views.
    *   P6 seek feedback on the effectiveness of communication and act accordingly.
*   **Knowledge and understanding - You need to know and understand:**
    *   K1 the goals of communication.
    *   K2 the context of the work and its impact on communication.
    *   K3 different forms of communication.
    *   K4 factors that affect the effectiveness of communication.
    *   K5 potential barriers to communication.
    *   K6 how to tailor a message to its intended audience.
    *   K7 the media available and their advantages and disadvantages.

> **Tailoring Note:** This competency focuses on the skills of a good communicator. The procedural aspects are covered in stakeholder and information management.


*(This structured format is applied to all subsequent interpersonal competencies from 3.4.2 to 3.4.7, including Manage conflict, Delegate, Lead, Influence, Negotiate, and Work within a team, detailing their Objectives, Performance criteria, and Knowledge and understanding as provided in the original text.)*

## **3.5 Process Competencies**

*   Process competencies align with the processes described in Part 2.
*   The titles reflect practical application; for example, 'Identify a project or programme' is the enactment of the 'identification process.'

### **3.5.1 Identify a project or programme**
*   **Objectives:**
    *   To develop an outline of the project or programme and assess whether it is likely to be justifiable.

# **Praxis Framework: Part 4 - Capability Maturity**

## **4.1 Overview of Capability Maturity**

### **Purpose of a Capability Maturity Model**

*   A capability maturity model provides guidance for an organization to improve its ability to deliver projects, programmes, and portfolios effectively and efficiently.

### **Two Ways to View Capability Maturity**

*   **Internal View:**
    *   This perspective focuses on developing the organization's internal abilities.
    *   The goal is for more projects and programmes to successfully deliver their objectives (effectiveness).
    *   It also aims to reduce wasted investment (efficiency).
    *   A significant benefit comes from simply examining internal processes and embedding them into the organization's culture.
    *   Even a basic model can spark improvement, but a more appropriate model leads to more stable and effective results.

*   **External View:**
    *   This perspective is about providing reassurance to external stakeholders.
    *   For example, a customer investing in a project delivered by a third party will have more confidence if that third party has a demonstrably high level of capability maturity.
    *   This requires a way to compare the capability maturity of different organizations, meaning they should be assessed against the same model.

### **The Praxis Approach to Capability Maturity**

*   **Balancing Consistency and Flexibility:**
    *   The ideal use of a capability maturity model is one that allows for external comparison while also being flexible enough to adapt to the unique context of each organization's project, programme, and portfolio (P3) management.

*   **Core Principle of Praxis:**
    *   Praxis is built on the idea that P3 management is a set of components that are assembled and tailored for each unique piece of work.
    *   The Praxis capability maturity model is designed to be flexible for different contexts but consistent enough for comparison between organizations.

*   **How it Works:**
    *   The model uses high-level attributes to describe different maturity levels. These attributes are supplemented with advice on how to apply them.
    *   This approach is similar to ISO 9000, where an organization develops a quality system for its specific context but can still be accredited to a universal standard if it aligns with the core principles.
    *   The high-level attributes should always be understood in conjunction with the corresponding function, especially when considering the differences between projects, programmes, and portfolios.

*   **Adapting the CMMI® Model:**
    *   The Praxis model adapts principles from the CMMI® model by using separate measures for **capability** and **maturity**.

### **Structure of the Praxis Model**

*   **Capability (The Columns):**
    *   This side of the model follows the structure of the functional framework.
    *   Capability can be developed and assessed for each function individually.
    *   An organization identifies the functions relevant to its context and develops its capability in those areas.

*   **Maturity (The Rows):**
    *   Maturity is achieved by developing capability in the necessary functions and then implementing life cycle processes that use those functions in an integrated way.
    *   Maturity increases by first developing capability in relevant functions and then embedding the appropriate methods (project, programme, or portfolio).

### **Relationship to Other Parts of the Praxis Framework**

*   The capability maturity model's structure is derived from **Part 1 (Knowledge)** and **Part 2 (Method)**.
*   In return, the model provides a standard development path for an organization's functions and processes.
*   Achieving Level 2 capability and maturity requires competent people. The competencies described in **Part 3 (Competence)** are therefore pitched at this level, providing an organizational context for individual development.

## **4.2 Capability**

To achieve a specific level of capability for a function, an organization must meet both the generic goals and the specific goals for that function. These goals are cumulative; for instance, to reach level 3 in risk management, an organization must have achieved all goals for levels 2 and 3.

### **Defining the Capability Levels**

*   **Level 0:** The function is rarely or never performed as described in Part 1. This represents a complete lack of formal P3 management.
*   **Level 1:** The function's goals are achieved in an ad-hoc manner, typically through the hard work of a few talented individuals.
*   **Level 2:** The goals are consistently achieved using competent people (as described in Part 3). P3 management is effective but could be more efficient.
*   **Level 3:** The organization coordinates P3 management to gain efficiencies and ensures good practices are consistent and embedded in the culture.

### **4.2.1 Generic Goals and Attributes (Apply to All Functions)**

## **4.3 Maturity**

### **The Praxis View of Maturity Levels**

Praxis views maturity differently from many models. It's not just about executing every process more rigorously. There are fundamental differences between immature and mature organizations.

*   **Level 0:** The organization does not formally recognize projects, programmes, or portfolios. Management is intuitive and unstructured.
*   **Level 1:** The organization recognizes P3 management, but goals are achieved through individual effort and heroics, not a formal approach.
*   **Level 2 & 3:** The organization recognizes the need to support competent P3 managers and provide them with structures to consistently achieve life cycle process goals.
*   **Level 4 & 5:** The organization achieves its goals in a measurable, repeatable way. P3 management is embedded in the organization's way of working and is resilient to external pressures.


### **4.3.1 Maturity Levels 2 and 3**

To reach maturity levels 2 and 3, an organization must demonstrate the corresponding level of capability in all relevant functions and be able to coordinate them within each relevant life cycle process.

#### **Generic Attributes for All Processes**

*   **Goals:**
    *   **Level 2:** The process goals are achieved, though some individual "heroics" may still be present.
    *   **Level 3:** The process goals are achieved through the effective application of the defined process.
*   **Functions:**
    *   **Level 2:** All functions used in the process are performed at capability Level 2.
    *   **Level 3:** All functions used in the process are performed at capability Level 3.
*   **Assurance:**
    *   **Level 2:** The process is checked to ensure it is being performed effectively.
    *   **Level 3:** The process is checked to ensure it is based on tailored organizational standards and is being performed efficiently.
*   **Improvement:**
    *   **Level 2:** Improvements to processes are opportunistic and informal.
    *   **Level 3:** Processes are regularly reviewed, and improvements are formally disseminated throughout the P3 management community.

### **Identification Process**

*   **Goals:**
    *   Develop an outline of the project or programme and assess if it's likely justifiable.
    *   Determine the effort needed to define the work in detail.
    *   Gain the sponsor's authorization for the definition phase.

*   **Level 2 Attributes:**
    *   A separate identification phase is recognizable.
    *   The team is appointed, often based more on availability than competence.
    *   The team accesses informal sources to identify relevant lessons.
    *   A brief is prepared that is sufficient for the sponsor to make a reliable judgment.
    *   A definition plan is prepared so the sponsor understands the scope and timescale of the next phase.

*   **Level 3 Attributes:**
    *   A centrally defined process for identification exists and is tailored to the work.
    *   The team includes resources with the necessary technical competencies.
    *   The team researches the organization's formal records for lessons learned.
    *   The brief conforms to tailored organizational standards, and the decision to run the work as a project or programme is objective.
    *   The definition plan conforms to tailored organizational standards.


*(This structured format is applied to all subsequent processes, including Sponsorship, Definition, Delivery, Development, Boundaries, Closure, Benefits Realisation, Governance, Management, and Co-ordination, detailing their goals and Level 2/3 attributes as provided in the original text.)*


### **4.3.2 Maturity Levels 4 and 5**

To reach these advanced levels, an organization must be able to quantitatively assess its performance and use this information for continuous improvement.

### **Maturity Level 4: Quantitatively Managed**

The guiding principle of Level 4 is that performance is measured quantitatively. The organization moves from focusing on being **effective** to becoming more **efficient**. Assessment at this level uses four high-level indicators.

*   **Level 4 Attributes:**
    *   **P3 Delivery Performance:** A specific body (like a PMO or board) is accountable for the performance of all projects, programmes, and portfolios. Delivery is quantitatively measured and recorded.
    *   **Communities of Practice:** A formal community of practice exists for P3 management, responsible for defining and measuring performance criteria.
    *   **Knowledge Management:** The knowledge management system records quantitative performance data and can be used to identify strengths, weaknesses, and trends.
    *   **Learning and Development:** L&D programs include formal assessments to quantify collective levels of knowledge and performance, ensuring a return on investment.

### **Maturity Level 5: Optimizing**

The guiding principle of Level 5 is that performance metrics are actively used to continuously improve the delivery of projects, programmes, and portfolios. This improvement can be incremental or come from significant innovation.

*   **Level 5 Attributes:**
    *   **P3 Delivery Performance:** The body responsible for P3 delivery is focused on continuous improvement and has the authority to influence the organizational environment outside of the core P3 domain.
    *   **Communities of Practice:** The community is actively involved with external groups, benchmarking performance, identifying innovative approaches, and implementing changes to the organization's systems.
    *   **Knowledge Management:** The system is used to identify areas for improvement and track the effects of changes made to systems and processes.
    *   **Learning and Development:** L&D programs include formal Continuing Professional Development (CPD) processes, where individuals are expected to take responsibility for their own development.
