# Maturity Level 1

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Maturity

## General Principles of Maturity

- Many guides describe five very similarly structured levels in their maturity models.

- Praxis takes a slightly different view. It does not see the growing maturity of an organisation as simply executing each and every process in an increasingly rigorous way.

- Instead, there are more **fundamental differences** in culture, behaviour, and integration that distinguish immature and mature organisations.

## The Maturity Levels in Praxis

### Level 0: None

- **Description**: Level 0 is simple. The organisation **does not formally recognise** the existence of projects, programmes, or portfolios as distinct types of work.

- **Behaviour**: "Projects" may be mentioned by name, but individuals simply manage them **intuitively** and without any formal structure, process, or governance.

- **Assessment**: Since this level represents the complete absence of formal P3 management, there is no need to define any specific indicators or attributes.

### Level 1: Initial

- **Description**: At Level 1, the organisation **recognises** that it undertakes projects, programmes, or portfolios and may even apply some isolated P3 management functions and processes.

- **Behaviour**: Goals are primarily achieved through **individual effort and heroics** rather than through a formal, repeatable approach. Success depends on having the "right people," and it is not reliably repeatable.

- **Assessment**: There is no need to define specific indicators for this level because it simply represents an organisation that nominally runs projects, programmes, or portfolios but has not yet reached the consistency and control of Level 2.

### Level 2: Managed & Level 3: Defined

- **Description**: These are the core levels defined in detail in the Praxis capability maturity model.

- **Behaviour**: These levels represent an organisation that recognises the need to:
    
    - Develop and support **competent P3 managers**.
    
    - Provide them with the **structures (processes and functions)** that allow them to **consistently achieve the goals** of the life cycle processes.

- **Focus**:
    
    - **Level 2** is about being **effective**—consistently getting the job done.
    
    - **Level 3** is about being **efficient**—using standard, tailored processes to get the job done in a consistent and optimised way, and learning from experience.

### Level 4: Quantitatively Managed & Level 5: Optimising

- **Description**: At these highest levels of maturity, the organisation is **regularly and predictably** achieving the goals of its life cycle processes in a **measurable and repeatable** way.

- **Behaviour**: These levels describe how the organisation fully **embeds** these highly effective and efficient practices into its core way of working.

- **Key Characteristic**: Effective P3 management in these organisations is **resilient**. It is resistant to the pressures of political, economic, and environmental change because the processes are so well-established, measured, and continuously improved.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is the key characteristic of a Level 0 organisation?
    - **A:** It does not formally recognise the existence of projects, programmes, or portfolios. Work is managed intuitively without any formal structure.

- **Q:** How are goals typically achieved in a Level 1 ("Initial") organisation?
    - **A:** Through individual effort and heroics, rather than through a formal, repeatable approach.

- **Q:** What are the two key things that a Level 2/3 organisation provides for its P3 managers?
    - **A:** It develops and supports **competent P3 managers** and provides them with the **structures (processes)** to consistently achieve their goals.

- **Q:** What is the primary difference between a Level 3 and a Level 5 organisation?
    - **A:** A Level 3 organisation is efficient and consistent. A Level 5 organisation takes this further by quantitatively managing its processes and being in a state of continuous improvement, making its P3 management capability highly **resilient** to external pressures.

- **Q:** How does the Praxis view of maturity differ from a simple, linear progression?
    - **A:** Praxis sees more fundamental differences between the levels related to culture, recognition, and resilience, rather than just executing the same processes with increasing rigour.
