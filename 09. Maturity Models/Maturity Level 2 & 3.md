# Maturity Level 2 & 3

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Maturity Levels 2 and 3

## Introduction to Maturity Levels 2 and 3

- Maturity levels 2 ("Managed") and 3 ("Defined") represent the core journey for an organisation moving from ad-hoc project delivery to a state of consistent and efficient P3 management.

- These levels are about an organisation recognising the need to develop and support competent P3 managers and providing them with the structures (processes) to consistently achieve their goals.

## The Foundational Principle of Maturity

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To reach maturity levels 2 and 3, an organisation must first demonstrate a corresponding level of capability in the relevant individual functions. Maturity is then achieved by the ability to co-ordinate and integrate these capable functions within each of the relevant life cycle processes.
> 
> In simple terms: **Maturity = Capability + Integration via Processes**

### The Maturity Hierarchy

- Maturity is built from the ground up. There is a clear hierarchical dependency:
    
    - To reach a level of maturity for **portfolio management**, the component programmes and projects must be managed at a similar level of maturity.
    
    - To reach a level of maturity for **programme management**, the component projects must be managed at a similar level of maturity.

## Generic Attributes of Maturity Levels 2 and 3

- The following generic indicators and attributes apply to all P3 processes (project, programme, and portfolio).

|Indicator|Level 2 Attributes ("Managed")|Level 3 Attributes ("Defined")|
|---|---|---|
|**Goals**|The goals of the process are achieved, although some elements of "Level 1 heroics" may still be observed.|The goals of the process are achieved consistently through the effective and efficient application of the process itself.|
|**Functions**|All functions used to conduct the processes are performed to at least **capability level 2**.|All functions used to conduct the processes are performed to at least **capability level 3**.|
|**Assurance**|The process is checked to ensure that it is being performed **effectively** (i.e., it is achieving its goals).|The process is checked to ensure it is based on **organisational standards**, has been **tailored** to the context, and is being performed **efficiently**.|
|**Improvement**|Improvements to processes and procedures are **opportunistic and informal**.|Processes and procedures are **regularly reviewed**. Improvements are made as necessary and are **formally disseminated** throughout the P3 management community.|

## Detailed Explanation of Attributes

### Goals

- **Level 2**: The organisation successfully completes its projects and programmes, but this success might still depend on the extra effort and talent of key individuals to overcome process gaps or inconsistencies. The process helps, but it doesn't guarantee success on its own.

- **Level 3**: Success is a direct and repeatable result of following the established process. The process is robust enough to guide the team to its goals consistently, without relying on individual "heroics."

### Functions

- **Level 2**: To achieve Level 2 maturity, the underlying functions (e.g., risk management, scope management) must each be at **capability level 2**. This means they are planned, performed by competent people, monitored, and controlled.

- **Level 3**: To achieve Level 3 maturity, the underlying functions must each be at **capability level 3**. This means they are performed according to a centrally defined, standard procedure that is tailored to the context, and lessons are learned and fed back into the organisational standard.

### Assurance

- **Level 2**: The focus of assurance is on **effectiveness**. An assurance review will ask: "Did the definition process produce a viable business case? Is the process working?"

- **Level 3**: The focus of assurance is on **efficiency and compliance with tailored standards**. An assurance review will ask: "Was the definition process based on the organisational standard? Was it appropriately tailored for this project's complexity? Is it being performed in the most efficient way?"

### Improvement

- **Level 2**: Process improvement happens, but it's often reactive and informal. A project manager might figure out a better way to do something and share it with their immediate colleagues. The improvement isn't captured or shared systematically.

- **Level 3**: Process improvement is a formal, proactive activity. There is a defined mechanism for regularly reviewing the standard processes, collecting feedback and lessons learned, and formally updating and disseminating the improved processes throughout the entire P3 management community (e.g., via a PMO or a knowledge management system).

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is the fundamental formula for achieving maturity in the Praxis Framework?
    - **A:** Maturity = Capability + Integration via Processes.

- **Q:** Can an organisation achieve Level 3 maturity in its Programme Management processes if its Project Management processes are only at Level 1?
    - **A:** No. There is a hierarchy; programme maturity requires that the component projects are managed at a similar level of maturity.

- **Q:** What is the key difference in how goals are achieved between Level 2 and Level 3?
    - **A:** At Level 2, achieving goals may still rely on some "individual heroics." At Level 3, goals are achieved consistently through the effective application of the process itself.

- **Q:** What is the main difference in the focus of "Assurance" between Level 2 and Level 3?
    - **A:** Level 2 assurance focuses on **effectiveness** (is the process working?). Level 3 assurance focuses on **efficiency** and compliance with **tailored organisational standards**.

- **Q:** How does process improvement differ between Level 2 and Level 3?
    - **A:** At Level 2, improvement is opportunistic and informal. At Level 3, it is a regular, formal activity where improvements are systematically captured and disseminated throughout the organisation.
