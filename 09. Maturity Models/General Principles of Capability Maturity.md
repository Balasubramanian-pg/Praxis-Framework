# Comprehensive Study Notes: Capability Maturity Overview

## General Principles of Capability Maturity

- **Definition**: A capability maturity model is a framework used to provide guidance in the development of an organisation’s ability to deliver projects, programmes, and portfolios effectively and efficiently.

- The models are based on the premise that the quality of a system or product is highly influenced by the quality of the process used to develop and manage it.

### The Two Views of Capability Maturity

1. **Internal View**:
    
    - **Purpose**: This view is about improving the organisation for its own benefit.
    
    - **Goals**: To develop the organisation’s ability so that more projects and programmes deliver their objectives (**effectiveness**) and less investment is wasted (**efficiency**).
    
    - **Mechanism**: A large proportion of the benefit is achieved simply by examining internal processes and making sure they are embedded in the culture. The model acts as a catalyst for this internal improvement.

2. **External View**:
    
    - **Purpose**: This view concerns the reassurance of external stakeholders.
    
    - **Example**: A customer investing in a project will have more confidence in a supplier that has a demonstrably high level of capability maturity.
    
    - **Requirement**: This external view implicitly requires the capability maturity of different organisations to be comparable, meaning they should have been assessed against the same model.

## The Praxis Capability Maturity Model Approach

- The underpinning principle of Praxis is that P3 management is made up of a broad set of components that are assembled and tailored to suit the context of each unique piece of work.

- The Praxis capability maturity model aims to be:
    
    - **Flexible** enough to be adaptable to different contexts.
    
    - **Consistent** enough to allow for meaningful comparison between different organisations.

> [NOTE]  
> This approach is not dissimilar to the approach taken by ISO9000 for quality. Each organisation can develop a system to suit its own context but, provided the system aligns with the core principles, it can still be accredited to a universally accepted standard. This is achieved by setting the attributes that describe the different levels of maturity at a fairly high level and supplementing them with advice on their application.

## The Structure of the Praxis Model (Based on CMMI®)

- The Praxis maturity model adapts the principles of the **CMMI® (Capability Maturity Model® Integration)** by applying two separate but related measures: one for **capability** and one for **maturity**.

### 1. The Capability Scale

- **Focus**: The capability side of the model follows the structure of the **functional framework** (the Knowledge section).

- **Application**: Capability is developed and assessed on a **function-by-function basis** (e.g., risk management, scope management).

- **Process**: An organisation identifies the functions that are appropriate to its context and then focuses on developing its capability in those specific functions.

### 2. The Maturity Scale

- **Focus**: Maturity is achieved by developing capability _and_ then implementing the **life cycle processes** (from the Method section) that apply those functions in an **integrated and co-ordinated way**.

- **The Formula**: **Maturity = Capability + Integration via Processes**

- **Application**: An organisation's overall maturity is judged by the level it has achieved in _all the appropriate processes_ for its typical projects, programmes, and portfolios.

### Describing the Levels

- **For Capability (Functions)**:
    
    - Praxis describes each function using a set of **indicators**.
    
    - For each indicator, specific **attributes** are described that illustrate the different levels of capability.
    
    - A large proportion of these indicators and attributes are common to all functions; these are collected together as the **generic goals of capability**.

- **For Maturity (Processes)**:
    
    - Maturity levels are described for each life cycle process (e.g., Identification Process, Definition Process).
    
    - This does not imply an organisation has a different maturity level for each process. The overall maturity level is the one achieved across _all_ the processes that are relevant to the organisation's context.

## How Maturity Relates to the Other Praxis Sections

- The capability maturity model acts as an integrator for the whole Praxis Framework.

- **Relationship with Knowledge and Method**:
    
    - The maturity model **derives its structure** directly from the **functions** in the Knowledge section and the **processes** in the Method section.
    
    - In return, it describes a series of attributes that outline a standard development path for improving those functions and processes.

- **Relationship with Competence**:
    
    - Capability and maturity at **level 2** require the deployment of **competent people**.
    
    - For this reason, the competencies defined in the Praxis Framework are pitched at the level required to perform in a level 2 organisation.
    
    - The maturity model provides the organisational context for the development and application of individual competencies.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What are the two "views" or purposes of a capability maturity model?
    - **A:** The **internal view** (for self-improvement in effectiveness and efficiency) and the **external view** (to reassure stakeholders and for comparison).

- **Q:** What is the fundamental difference between the "capability" scale and the "maturity" scale in the Praxis model?
    - **A:** The **capability** scale applies to individual **functions** (e.g., risk management). The **maturity** scale applies to the integrated **life cycle processes** that use those functions.

- **Q:** What is the "formula" for achieving maturity?
    - **A:** Maturity = Capability + Integration via Processes.

- **Q:** The competencies defined in the Praxis Framework are pitched at what level of capability/maturity?
    - **A:** Level 2, because this is the level that requires the deployment of competent people.

- **Q:** How is an organisation's overall maturity level judged?
    - **A:** It is the level achieved in **all the appropriate processes** for the context of its projects, programmes, and portfolios.
