# Comprehensive Study Notes: Capability Maturity

## General Principles of Capability Maturity

- **Definition**: Capability and maturity are typically represented as a model against which an organisation’s performance in a particular area (like P3 management) can be measured and improved.

- These models are based on the premise that the quality of a system or product is highly influenced by the quality of the process used to develop and manage it.

### The Goals of Capability and Maturity Management

- The primary goals of using a capability maturity model in a P3 context are to:
    
    - **Assess** the ability of an organisation to perform project, programme, and portfolio management effectively and efficiently.
    
    - **Identify** how the organisation can improve its P3 management practices in a structured way.
    
    - **Promote** the improvement of P3 management against an independent, recognised standard.

### Origins and Praxis Adaptation

- The idea of a sequential, staged capability maturity model was popularised by the **Software Engineering Institute (SEI)** at Carnegie Mellon University in the USA.

- The original SEI Capability Maturity Model (CMM) was published in 1993. The current version is the **CMMI® (Capability Maturity Model® Integration)**.

- The Praxis Framework adapts and applies the principles of CMMI® to P3 management.

> [!NOTE]  
> A key concept in CMMI® and Praxis is the use of two distinct but related scales: one for capability and one for maturity. Capability addresses the performance of individual functions or process areas, while maturity addresses the performance of the overarching, integrated life cycle processes.

## The Two Scales: Capability vs. Maturity

### The Capability Scale (Levels 0-3)

- The capability scale is used to assess individual knowledge functions (e.g., risk management, scope management).

- **Level 0 – Incomplete**:
    
    - The function is not performed or is only partially performed.
    
    - The fundamental goals of the function are not achieved.

- **Level 1 – Performed**:
    
    - The function is performed, and its goals are generally achieved.
    
    - However, the procedures and application are inconsistent and are not embedded in the organisational culture.
    
    - Success often relies on the ad-hoc efforts of individuals.

- **Level 2 – Managed**:
    
    - The function is managed in accordance with a defined policy.
    
    - It is performed by competent people who are given adequate resources to produce controlled outputs.
    
    - The function is actively monitored to ensure it adheres to its description.

- **Level 3 – Defined**:
    
    - The function is consistently managed across the organisation using tailored versions of a standard, centrally-defined approach.
    
    - Lessons are captured from its application and contribute to the organisation's shared knowledge base.

### The Maturity Scale (Levels 1-5)

- The maturity scale is used to assess the overall, integrated life cycle processes. It describes the stages of an organisation's development from chaotic beginnings to a state of continuous improvement.

- **Level 1 - Initial**:
    
    - Processes are ad hoc and occasionally chaotic.
    
    - The organisation does not provide a stable environment to support P3 functions.
    
    - Success depends on individual effort and "heroics" rather than on proven processes.
    
    - Organisations at this level often deliver their objectives but frequently exceed budgets and schedules. They tend to overcommit, abandon processes in times of crisis, and are unable to reliably replicate their past successes.

- **Level 2 - Managed**:
    
    - The relevant functions are managed to at least **capability level 2**.
    
    - An overarching life cycle process ensures that functional procedures are maintained even during times of stress.
    
    - Progress is visible to management at defined points (e.g., gate reviews).

- **Level 3 - Defined**:
    
    - The relevant functions are managed to at least **capability level 3**.
    
    - Projects, programmes, and portfolios tailor their functional procedures from a centrally defined standard set of processes.
    
    - The organisation actively works to improve its standard processes and procedures based on feedback and lessons learned.

- **Level 4 – Quantitatively Managed**:
    
    - Performance metrics are systematically gathered and used to control future performance.
    
    - Quality and performance are understood and managed in statistical terms, allowing for more accurate prediction.

- **Level 5 - Optimising**:
    - Continuous process improvement is a core part of the culture, enabled by quantitative feedback from the process and from piloting innovative ideas and new technologies.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The Aspiration: Level 3 - The Effective Organisation  
> For most organisations, the primary goal is to achieve maturity level 3. This represents the point where the organisation is considered "effective" at P3 management. The return on investment for achieving level 3 is significant and includes:
> 
> - A reduction in time and cost overruns.
> 
> - Greater predictability in the achievement of objectives.
> 
> - A more robust and therefore less risky delivery environment.  
>     Levels 4 and 5 are primarily concerned with becoming more **efficient**, meaning the benefits of Level 3 are retained but less effort is expended in maintaining them.

## Context is Key

> [!TIP]  
> Maturity is sensitive to the context of the projects, programmes, and portfolios an organisation undertakes. The Praxis approach is similar to ISO9000 quality standards in that an organisation defines its own required scope of capability maturity against which it will benchmark and improve. It is not necessary to achieve high capability in functions or processes that an organisation does not normally perform.

## Application in Projects, Programmes, and Portfolios

### Projects

- Projects are the fundamental building blocks of both programmes and portfolios.

- It is highly unlikely that an organisation could develop a mature approach to delivering programmes without first establishing a consistent and mature way of managing projects.

### Programmes

- Ideally, programmes are initiated in an environment where project management is already well-established (i.e., at a reasonable maturity level).

- However, it is common for an organisation to collect a group of inconsistently managed projects into a new programme.

- This presents an opportunity. The programme management team can establish programme-wide governance and standard processes for all its component projects.

- In this way, a programme can not only deliver its defined change and benefits but also act as a **catalyst for improving the maturity of project management** within its sphere of influence.

### Portfolios

- The goals for maturity at the portfolio level often depend on the type of portfolio.

- **Standard Portfolio**:
    
    - This type of portfolio (e.g., in a contracting organisation) is often made up of independent projects and programmes.
    
    - The emphasis is on developing the maturity of the component projects and programmes through standardised methods and functions. This is sometimes known as "management of projects".
    
    - This approach can readily achieve **maturity level 3**, ensuring consistent and effective delivery across the board.

- **Structured Portfolio**:
    
    - This type of portfolio is aligned with delivering strategic change.
    
    - Progression to the highest levels of maturity (Level 4 and 5) requires more than just mature components. It requires the application of a defined, mature **portfolio management process** itself, including quantitative management and continuous optimisation of the entire portfolio.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is the primary goal of using a capability maturity model?
    - **A:** To assess an organisation's ability to perform P3 management effectively, identify how it can improve, and promote that improvement against a standard.

- **Q:** What is the key difference between the "capability" scale and the "maturity" scale?
    - **A:** The **capability** scale assesses individual functions (e.g., risk management), while the **maturity** scale assesses the overall, integrated life cycle process that combines those functions.

- **Q:** Describe a Level 1 ("Initial") maturity organisation.
    - **A:** Its processes are ad hoc and chaotic, and success depends on individual heroics rather than stable processes. It often exceeds budgets and schedules and cannot reliably replicate its successes.

- **Q:** What maturity level represents the "effective organisation" and is the primary goal for most?
    - **A:** Level 3 ("Defined").

- **Q:** How can a programme act as a "catalyst for improving maturity"?
    - **A:** By establishing consistent, programme-wide governance and standard processes for its component projects, especially if they were previously managed in an inconsistent manner.

- **Q:** What is the main difference in maturity goals between a standard and a structured portfolio?
    - **A:** A standard portfolio typically aims for Level 3 (effective management of projects). A structured portfolio may aim for Levels 4 and 5, which requires a mature portfolio management process itself, not just mature components.
