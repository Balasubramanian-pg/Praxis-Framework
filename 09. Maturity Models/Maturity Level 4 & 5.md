# Maturity Level 4 & 5

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Maturity Levels 4 and 5

## Introduction to Levels 4 and 5

- To reach maturity levels 4 and 5, an organisation must be able to **quantitatively assess** its performance and use this information to **improve continuously**.

- The guiding principle of **Level 4** is that performance is measured quantitatively. The focus shifts from simply being _effective_ (achieving goals, as in Levels 2 & 3) to becoming more **efficient** (achieving goals with less waste and more predictability), whilst remaining effective.

- The guiding principle of **Level 5** is that these performance metrics are then actively used to drive **continuous improvement**, which can be slow and incremental or achieved in significant steps through innovation.

> [!NOTE]  
> In the Praxis approach to assessing capability maturity, these high-level functions are typically assessed as part of the portfolio management processes. This is because the portfolio level has the strategic oversight and permanence required to implement and manage organisation-wide quantitative measurement and improvement initiatives.

## Level 4: Quantitatively Managed

- At this level, the organisation is regularly achieving the goals of its life cycle processes in a measurable and repeatable way.

|Indicator|Level 4 Attributes|
|---|---|
|**P3 Delivery Performance**|A body exists that is **accountable for the performance** of projects, programmes, and portfolios across the host organisation.<br><br>The delivery of objectives is **quantitatively measured and recorded**.|
|**Communities of Practice**|A Community of Practice (CoP) exists for P3 management.<br><br>This community has the responsibility for **defining and measuring** P3 management performance criteria.|
|**Knowledge Management**|The knowledge management system **records data from the quantitative measurement** of functions and processes.<br><br>It can be used to identify strengths, weaknesses, and **trends**.|
|**Learning and Development**|Learning and development programmes include **formal assessments to quantify levels of individual knowledge and performance** on an ongoing basis.|

### Detailed Explanation of Level 4 Attributes

- **P3 Delivery Performance**:
    
    - A formal, accountable body now "owns" P3 management across the organisation. This could be the company Board, a Portfolio Board, or a specially constituted group like a P3 Management Office (PMO).
    
    - Success is no longer just a qualitative judgement; it is measured and recorded using quantitative data (e.g., schedule performance index, cost performance index, percentage of projects meeting business case targets).

- **Communities of Practice (CoPs)**:
    
    - The CoP matures from being a simple knowledge-sharing forum to a body with a formal role.
    
    - It becomes responsible for defining _what_ good performance looks like and _how_ it should be measured, establishing the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the profession within the organisation.

- **Knowledge Management**:
    
    - The knowledge management system evolves. It is no longer just a repository for textual information like lessons learned reports.
    
    - At Level 4, the system needs to be able to store, manage, and enable the **quantitative analysis of performance data** to identify trends (e.g., "Are our cost estimates consistently 10% too low in the definition phase?").

- **Learning and Development**:
    
    - This is not about the initial tests or qualifications needed to become competent (which are a requirement of Level 2).
    
    - Level 4 learning and development is about **collective, ongoing assessment** to confirm that the organisation's overall levels of knowledge and competence are being maintained and to understand the **return on investment** from training initiatives.

## Level 5: Optimising

- At this level, performance metrics are actively used to continuously improve the delivery of projects, programmes, and portfolios.

|Indicator|Level 5 Attributes|
|---|---|
|**P3 Delivery Performance**|A body exists that is **responsible for the continuous improvement** of the delivery of projects, programmes, and portfolios across the host organisation.<br><br>This body has **authority in areas within the host organisation that constitute the environment** of each project, programme, or portfolio.|
|**Communities of Practice**|The CoP is actively involved in similar communities **external to the host organisation**.<br><br>It is involved in **benchmarking**, the identification of innovative approaches, and the implementation of changes to the organisation’s systems and processes.|
|**Knowledge Management**|The knowledge management system is used to **proactively identify areas for improvement** and to **track the effect of changes** made to the organisation’s systems, procedures, and processes.|
|**Learning and Development**|Learning and development programmes include formal **Continuing Professional Development (CPD)** processes.|

### Detailed Explanation of Level 5 Attributes

- **P3 Delivery Performance**:
    
    - The accountable body from Level 4 now has a formal mandate for **continuous improvement**.
    
    - Crucially, this body must have some degree of **authority outside the core P3 domain**. The ability to deliver objectives is often affected by factors in the wider organisational environment (e.g., HR policies, finance systems). To achieve true continuous improvement, this body must have the influence to drive changes in these related areas.

- **Communities of Practice (CoPs)**:
    
    - The CoP becomes outwardly focused.
    
    - It actively maintains external links to other organisations and professional bodies to **benchmark** its performance against others and to identify **innovations** that may deliver a step-change in improvement. It then helps to implement these innovations.

- **Knowledge Management**:
    
    - The knowledge management system becomes a proactive tool for improvement.
    
    - It is used to analyse the quantitative data to **identify systemic areas for improvement** (e.g., "Our projects consistently struggle with stakeholder engagement in the delivery phase").
    
    - It is also used to **track the effect of improvement initiatives** to confirm whether a change to a process has had the desired positive impact on performance.

- **Learning and Development**:
    
    - The organisation establishes formal **Continuing Professional Development (CPD)** processes.
    
    - At this level, the organisation expects its P3 managers to take personal **responsibility for their own development** and will formally track the effort individuals put into their CPD.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is the key guiding principle that distinguishes Level 4 maturity?
    - **A:** Performance is measured **quantitatively**. The focus shifts from being effective to becoming **efficient**.

- **Q:** What is the key guiding principle that distinguishes Level 5 maturity?
    - **A:** Performance metrics are actively used to drive **continuous improvement**.

- **Q:** How does the role of the Knowledge Management System change from Level 3 to Level 4?
    - **A:** It evolves from managing primarily textual information (like lessons learned) to a system that can **record and analyse quantitative performance data** to identify trends.

- **Q:** At Level 5, why must the body responsible for P3 performance have authority outside the P3 domain?
    - **A:** Because the ability to deliver is often affected by factors in the wider organisational environment (e.g., HR, finance systems). To drive true continuous improvement, the body must have the authority to influence changes in these related areas.

- **Q:** How does the focus of the Community of Practice (CoP) change at Level 5?
    - **A:** It becomes **outwardly focused**, actively engaging with external communities and professional bodies to benchmark performance and identify innovations.
