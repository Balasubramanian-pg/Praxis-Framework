# Comprehensive Study Notes: Project and Programme Processes

## Overview of the Praxis Process Model

- The Praxis method provides a **single, generic process model** for managing both projects and programmes.

- This approach is based on the principle that projects and programmes have very similar life cycles and are fundamentally the same type of initiative, differing primarily in their level of **complexity**.

- The process model is based directly on the life cycle phases, with an additional process to address the crucial **sponsorship** function.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This generic model can, and should, be tailored to the specific context of the work. Each process is supported by competence and maturity definitions that remain relevant even if the Praxis process is replaced with a corresponding process from another guide, such as PRINCE2® or ISO21500.

## The Generic Project and Programme Process Model

- The model consists of a sequence of life cycle processes, an overarching sponsorship process, and additional processes for managing complexity.

### The Core Life Cycle Processes

1. **Sponsorship Process**:
    
    - This is an additional process that runs in parallel with the main life cycle.
    
    - It addresses the goals and activities of the sponsor, who provides the link between the delivery team and senior management, owns the business case, and makes key decisions.

2. **Identification Process**:
    
    - The first phase of the life cycle.
    
    - It takes an initial idea or mandate and develops it into an outline business case and a project or programme brief.
    
    - The goal is to provide enough information for a decision to be made on whether to invest in a full definition.

3. **Definition Process**:
    
    - If the brief is approved, this process takes over.
    
    - It involves the detailed planning of all aspects of the work, resulting in a full business case and the complete set of management and delivery plans.
    
    - The goal is to provide the information needed for a final "go/no-go" decision on authorising the main delivery phase.

4. **Delivery Process(es)**:
    
    - This is the heart of the life cycle, where the actual work to create the outputs is performed and managed.
    
    - As the scope of the work becomes more complex, its primary impact is on the delivery phase. This is why the model refers to multiple **delivery process(es)**, as the work may be broken down into many different streams.

5. **Benefits Realisation Process**:
    
    - This process runs in parallel with, and often extends beyond, the delivery process.
    
    - It is concerned with managing the organisational change required to convert the outputs from delivery into tangible outcomes and measurable benefits.

6. **Closure Process**:
    
    - The final phase of the life cycle.
    
    - It involves the formal handover of outputs, the demobilisation of the team, the closing of contracts and finances, and the capturing of lessons learned.

### Processes for Managing Complexity

- **Boundaries Process**:
    
    - This process is used when the delivery phase needs to be segmented into manageable chunks.
    
    - These chunks are called **stages** in a project or **tranches** in a programme.
    
    - The boundaries process manages the transition from one stage/tranche to the next, including a formal review of the business case.

- **Development Process**:
    
    - This process is used where the delivery work is delegated to multiple production teams (e.g., internal teams, suppliers).
    
    - It describes the interface between the overall management team and the teams that are physically creating the products.

## Tailoring the Process Model for Different Contexts

> [!NOTE]  
> The primary difference between a project and a programme is the complexity of the objectives. This is reflected in the relationship between the delivery process(es) and the benefits realisation process. A complex programme will have a much greater emphasis on benefits realisation.

- The generic model should be adapted to fit the specific environment of the work.

### Example 1: A Project within a Programme

- When a project is part of a larger programme, some of the management processes will typically be performed by the programme team.

- **Programme-level responsibilities**: The programme will usually handle the **Identification Process** (defining the need for the project) and the **Benefits Realisation Process** (as benefits are a programme-level concern).

- **Resulting Project Model**: This results in a reduced, more focused set of processes for the project itself, which is primarily concerned with Definition, Delivery, and Closure. The programme manager often acts as the project's sponsor.

### Example 2: A Project Delivered by a Contractor

- In a typical client-contractor scenario, the responsibilities are divided between the two organisations.

- **Client Responsibilities**: The client will typically perform the **Identification Process** (defining their need) and the **Benefits Realisation Process** (as they are the ones who will use the output to gain benefits). They may also perform much of the **Definition Process**.

- **Contractor Responsibilities**: The contractor's process model is then limited to the elements they are responsible for, which is primarily the **Delivery Process** (building the output) and the **Closure Process** (handing it over), along with their own internal sponsorship and definition activities to manage their side of the contract.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** What is the fundamental principle behind Praxis using a single process model for both projects and programmes?
    - **A:** They have very similar, transient life cycles, and the model can be scaled and adapted to handle the main difference between them, which is complexity.

- **Q:** What are the six core processes in the generic project/programme model?
    - **A:** Sponsorship, Identification, Definition, Delivery, Benefits Realisation, and Closure.

- **Q:** What is the purpose of the "Boundaries Process"?
    - **A:** To manage the segmentation of the delivery phase into manageable chunks, known as stages (for projects) or tranches (for programmes).

- **Q:** For a project that is part of a larger programme, which two processes are typically handled by the programme management team?
    - **A:** The Identification Process and the Benefits Realisation Process.

- **Q:** In a client-contractor relationship, who is typically responsible for the Benefits Realisation Process?
    - **A:** The client, as they are the ones who will use the contractor's output to achieve benefits for their organisation.
