# Comprehensive Study Notes: Deliver a Project or Programme Competency

## Purpose of the Competency

- The purpose of this competency is to demonstrate the ability to achieve the goals of the **delivery process**. This process is the core "engine room" of the project or programme where the work is actively managed, controlled, and executed. The goals are to:
    
    - Delegate responsibility for producing deliverables to the appropriate people.
    
    - Monitor the performance of the work and track it against the delivery plans.
    
    - Take action where necessary to keep the work in line with the plans.
    
    - Escalate issues and replan if necessary.
    
    - Formally accept work as it is completed.
    
    - Maintain effective communication with all stakeholders throughout delivery.

## Performance Criteria

- An individual must be able to demonstrate the ability to perform the following actions:

- **Define, delegate, and accept work packages**
    
    - **Define**: Break down the work of a stage or tranche into logical, manageable units called **work packages**. Each work package must have a clear description, defined products, quality criteria, and constraints (time and cost).
    
    - **Delegate**: Formally assign the responsibility for a work package to a team manager or individual. This must be a clear and unambiguous delegation of authority.
    
    - **Accept**: Formally accept the completed products from the work package, ensuring they have met their quality criteria through inspection and testing, before taking ownership of them.

- **Monitor and co-ordinate progress across work packages**
    
    - This involves the day-to-day management of the delivery phase.
    
    - **Monitor**: Collect progress information from all active work packages (e.g., via checkpoint reports) and consolidate this data to get an accurate overall picture of the stage or tranche's status.
    
    - **Co-ordinate**: Actively manage the interdependencies between different work packages, resolving resource conflicts and ensuring that different teams can co-exist and work effectively.

- **Review and accept completed work**
    
    - This is the formal quality control aspect of the process.
    
    - It involves reviewing the deliverables from a work package against their specification and quality criteria.
    
    - This may involve inspections, testing, or formal demonstrations before formally signing off and accepting the completed work.

- **Predict issues, take corrective action, and escalate as required**
    
    - **Predict**: Use progress information and forecasting techniques to predict potential deviations from the plan _before_ they happen.
    
    - **Corrective Action**: Take appropriate action to resolve deviations and bring the work back in line with the plan, as long as the deviation is predicted to remain within the agreed **tolerances**.
    
    - **Escalate**: If a deviation is predicted to exceed the agreed tolerances, formally escalate this as an **issue** to the sponsor by creating an **Exception Report**.

- **Prepare exception plans and submit for authorisation**
    
    - When a major issue occurs that requires significant re-planning, this involves creating a new delivery plan to show how the issue will be overcome. This new plan is called an **exception plan**.
    
    - This plan must be formally submitted to the sponsor for their review and authorisation before it can be implemented.

- **Maintain effective communication at all times**
    
    - This involves executing the communications plan.
    
    - It includes providing regular progress reports to stakeholders, keeping the team informed of progress and issues, and ensuring there are clear lines of communication for escalating problems.

- **Assure the quality of the process**
    
    - This involves ensuring that the delivery process itself is being conducted effectively and according to the rules set out in the management plans.
    
    - It includes checking that work packages are being properly authorised, progress is being tracked accurately, and issues are being escalated correctly.

> [NOTE]  
> The principles of the delivery process remain the same regardless of scale, but the competency must be adapted to reflect the context. For a small project, the manager may be managing a handful of part-time resources. For a large programme, they may be co-ordinating a vast range of internal and external teams. This could require the competency to include references to more specific functional competencies, like Manage Contracts, or specific control techniques, like Earned Value Management.

## Knowledge and Understanding

- An individual needs to know and understand the following principles and concepts:

- **The goals of the process**
    - Understanding that the delivery process is the iterative cycle of authorising work, monitoring progress, and taking control actions to successfully deliver the objectives of a stage or tranche.

- **The typical activities that make up the process**
    - Knowing the "Plan-Do-Check-Act" cycle as it applies to delivery: Authorise Work -> Co-ordinate & Monitor -> Update & Communicate -> Corrective Action -> Accept Work.

- **The context of the work and its impact on the process**
    - Understanding how the complexity of the work will affect how the process is applied (e.g., the difference between managing a single internal team vs. co-ordinating multiple external contractors).

- **How to create and delegate work packages**
    - Understanding what information must be included in a work package definition to make it a clear and effective instrument of delegation.

- **Techniques for tracking progress including, if required, consolidation across multiple work packages**
    - Knowing various techniques for monitoring and reporting progress, from simple checkpoint reports and progress updates to more sophisticated techniques like **Earned Value Management (EVM)**. Understanding the importance of consolidating progress from multiple sources to get a true overall picture.

- **How to identify potential issues and resolve or escalate them**
    - Understanding the concept of **tolerances** and the critical difference between taking corrective action for a deviation within tolerance versus escalating an issue that is predicted to exceed tolerance.

- **How to communicate progress**
    - Knowing how to create and use different types of reports (e.g., Highlight Reports, Exception Reports) to communicate status effectively to different stakeholders.

- **How assurance applies to the process**
    - Understanding how to review the delivery process to provide confidence that it is being managed effectively and in accordance with the project or programme management plan.

## Flashcard Q&A

- **Q:** The delivery process is based on what four-step management cycle?
    - **A:** The Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle.

- **Q:** What is a "work package"?
    - **A:** A document that defines and authorises a specific piece of work to be done by a team or individual. It is a key tool for delegation.

- **Q:** What is the key difference between "corrective action" and "escalation"?
    - **A:** **Corrective action** is taken by the manager to deal with a deviation that is _within_ their agreed tolerances. **Escalation** is what the manager must do when a deviation is predicted to _exceed_ their tolerances.

- **Q:** What is an "exception plan"?
    - **A:** A new plan created to show how a major issue (an "exception") will be resolved. It must be submitted to the sponsor for approval.

- _Q:_The formal acceptance of completed work signifies what?
    - **A:** The transfer of ownership of the products from the delivery team to the management team.
